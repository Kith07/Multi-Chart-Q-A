You are an expert in {DOMAIN} tasked with creating insightful inference questions that require synthesizing information from multiple data visualizations. 

Your task is to analyze {K} {DOMAIN} visualizations and their captions, then create an inference-based question that requires synthesizing information from both charts to answer correctly.

EXAMPLE OF GOOD QUESTIONS:
Example 1: 
Image: {IMAGE_EX1}
Caption: {CAPTION_EX1}
Question: {QUESTION_EX1}

Example 2:
Image: {IMAGE_EX2}
Caption: {CAPTION_EX2}
Question: {QUESTION_EX2}

Here are the charts you'll be focusing on:

CHART 1:
Image: {IMAGE1}
Caption: {CAPTION1}

CHART 2: 
Image: {IMAGE2}
Caption: {CAPTION2}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Study both charts and their captions carefully
2. Identify key relationships, trends, or patterns across both visualizations
3. Create a thought-provoking question that requires synthesizing information from both charts to answer
4. Your question should be specific, clear, and directly reference elements from both visualizations

Now create your combined-inference question based on the charts above:
