QUESTION: Considering the historical correlations shown in File 1 between declining atmospheric CO2 levels and increased continental glaciation, alongside the projected reduction in fossil fuel consumption from 2020 to 2100 under scenario 'S' from File 2, how might the expansion of global continental glaciation by 2100 be influenced if the trends toward reduced fossil fuel use continue, based on historical geological data?
