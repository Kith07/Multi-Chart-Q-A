QUESTION: How does the variability in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) strength as projected by different climate models at 30Â°N correlate with the fluctuations in activity levels measured in ppm over the years, and what joint impact might these patterns have on future climate scenarios, specifically concerning extreme weather events and sea level changes?
