Greetings! I was wondering if you could help me grade the following inference-based question asked by an expert in {DOMAIN}.

I'll first provide two sets of attributes that were given to the expert, and then give you the meaningful question the expert came up with, as well as the grading rubric.

The given charts and attributes are as follows:
{ATTRIBUTES1}

{ATTRIBUTES2} 

The expert's question was:
{QUESTION}

Using a rubric table format, please grade the expert's inference-based compositional question with positive scoring.

The criteria are:

- Attribute Set 1 Info:     Score/2 (Utilizes a large subset, but not all of the attributes from Set 1)
- Attribute Set 2 Info:     Score/2 (Utilizes a large subset, but not all of the attributes from Set 2)
- Attribute Composition:    Score/4 (Creates sophisticated connection between both sets of attributes while maintaining practicality and coherence and not simply using the attribute sets as a checklist)
- Clarity/Confidence:       Score/1 (Question is clear and could be answered with sufficient data with sufficient confidence)
- Concise:                  Score/1 (Question is short and summarized and not overly elaborate)

TOTAL SCORE: Score/10

The table should have two columns: 'Criteria', 'Points'. In the 'Points' column, please provide a score that is out of the max for that category/criteria. 

Please introduce the output table with 'Grading Rubric:' and please include a row for 'Total Points' at the end of the Table after all criteria. Finally, please start your grading explanation with 'ANSWER':
