ANSWER:
The grading for the expert's question reflects a high level of sophistication and relevance in integrating two distinct sets of data attributes, drawing an innovative connection between gender differences in life expectancy in Norway and climate variations in the Arctic.

1. **Attribute Set 1 Info** (Score: 2/2): The question adeptly incorporates the timeline, the gender-based life expectancy distinctions, and, implicitly, uses these factors to set up the basis for the inquiry.
   
2. **Attribute Set 2 Info** (Score: 2/2): The expert effectively invokes seasonal temperature variations, which is a central element of the second attribute set. This includes the use of temperature change and indirectly hints at the seasonal (monthly) aspect.

3. **Attribute Composition** (Score: 3/4): The expert creatively links life expectancy changes with seasonal temperature variations, proposing a hypothesis about climate impact on health that varies by gender. The connection is innovative and invites a multi-disciplinary approach to explore this correlation. The score is slightly reduced as the direct impact of such a broad climatic condition on specific health outcomes across genders, while intriguing, might stretch practical coherence without additional, specific data (for example, direct health impacts or more localized climate data).

4. **Clarity/Confidence** (Score: 1/1): The question is articulated in a clear and accessible manner, posing a clear hypothesis that could be investigated given appropriate cross-disciplinary data.

5. **Concise** (Score: 1/1): The question is succinct and to the point, effectively encapsulating a complex hypothesis in a single, well-structured sentence.

Overall, the question reflects an advanced level of inquiry that stimulates interdisciplinary research, albeit with slight deductions for the ambitious nature of connecting these specific datasets coherently.
