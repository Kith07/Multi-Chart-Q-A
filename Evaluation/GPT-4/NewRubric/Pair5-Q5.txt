ANSWER: The expert's question effectively uses the attributes from Set 2 focusing on cumulative mass loss and the specified geographic locations, thus earning a full score in that criterion. However, the reference to "cumulative mass loss" aligns more clearly with Set 2 attributes. The question only partially integrates the attributes from Set 1, notably missing explicit use of 'Cumulative CO2 emissions', which is crucial as a dependent variable for a comprehensive analysis in Set 1, hence the lower score in that criterion.

In terms of attribute composition, the question brings together the impacts of emission reductions on mass loss in a geographical context, presenting a sophisticated connection between emission reduction scenarios and geographically specific climate impacts derived from two distinct sets of attributes. However, the linkage could be clearer to encompass all attributes seamlessly from both sets, particularly the 'Cumulative CO2 emissions' from Set 1.

Clarity and confidence are high, as the question is well-phrased, making it easy to understand and actionable if the right data is available. It also succinctly captures a complex issue, which earns it full marks for being concise. The total score reflects a strong but slightly improvable approach in integrating and leveraging complex sets of data for policy-making applications.
