ANSWER: The expert's question effectively uses a significant subset of the attributes from both Set 1 and Set 2, directly linking data about GHG emissions and health (new cases per 100,000 differentiated by gender). The composition of the question is sophisticated, demonstrating a thoughtful integration of factors from two distinct areas (climate science and health), which suggests meaningful insights into how high emission scenarios could affect health outcomes. The question is both clear and concise, enabling straightforward understanding and feasibility for obtaining answers given sufficient data. Therefore, the expert's question scores a full 10 points out of 10, reflecting a high-quality inquiry that could lead to valuable interdisciplinary research and analysis.
