ANSWER:
The expert's inference-based question effectively uses the majority of the attributes from both set 1 (Ice Volume and Ice Thickness Anomalies) and set 2 (GDP Variation, GHG Emissions Reductions). These selections are pertinent to exploring the possible economic impacts of environmental changes and policy implementations.

1. **Attribute Set 1 Info (2/2):** The question efficiently incorporates key variables from Set 1â€”Ice Volume and Thickness Anomalies, which are central to understanding climatic changes.

2. **Attribute Set 2 Info (2/2):** The question integrates notable variables from Set 2, particularly GDP Variation and GHG Emissions Reductions, which are essential to assess the economic outcomes of environmental policies.

3. **Attribute Composition (3/4):** The connection made by the question between climatic variables and economic performance under the influence of environmental policies is both sophisticated and practical. However, it could further elaborate on how these relationships might manifest specifically, such as the direct impact of ice melting on economic activities linked to climate conditions.

4. **Clarity/Confidence (1/1):** The question is posed clearly, and with the right dataset, the query is reasonably answerable. It prompts a complex but approachable analysis involving multi-disciplinary data.

5. **Concise (1/1):** The question is concise, focusing directly on the relationship between the environmental and economic variables without unnecessary elaboration.

Overall, the expert's question is well-formed and thought-provoking, inviting a detailed examination of the intersections between climate science and economic metrics in the context of sustainable policies.
