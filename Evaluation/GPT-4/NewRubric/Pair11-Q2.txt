ANSWER: 
The expert's question effectively utilizes all the given attributes from both attribute sets addressed in the explanations, thereby receiving full scores in the 'Attribute Set 1 Info' and 'Attribute Set 2 Info' criteria. The question creatively links mortality data over specific timelines with energy efficiency indices across designated groups, which shows a sophisticated blend of datasets although deriving a straightforward causal relationship could be complex. This sophisticated interplay earns full points under 'Attribute Composition.'

The query itself is clearly framed and poses a conceivable hypothesis that could be explored given adequate data, which meets the criterion for 'Clarity/Confidence.' Finally, the question is focused and concise without extraneous details, satisfying the requirement for the 'Concise' criterion. Overall, the expert's formulation showcases a strong understanding of the attributes and the potential interdependencies between different data studies, thus justifying a perfect score.
