ANSWER: 
The question formulated by the expert does a commendable job of integrating information from both provided attribute sets and is poised to provoke deep analysis and meaningful conclusions in the context of climate science and policy implications.

1. **Attribute Set 1 Info**: The expert fully utilizes the projections of future global surface warming (a key element from the first set), which is central to the question asked. Hence, a full score is justified.

2. **Attribute Set 2 Info**: By focusing on the necessity of transformative policies based on regions with "currently high CO2 emissions per capita," the question effectively integrates critical elements from the second set of attributes. This justifies a full score in this category.

3. **Attribute Composition**: The question skillfully combines attributes from both sets, examining the intersection of future temperature increases and current emissions metrics to propose targeted policy interventions. Though it addresses core attributes from both sets, it marginally lacks in utilizing all aspects explicitly, such as specific mentions of GDP-related metrics, warranting a slight deduction.

4. **Clarity/Confidence**: The question is clearly stated, focusing on which regions require policy change based on specific criteria. It is constructed in a manner that allows for confidence in answerability given appropriate data, which merits a full score here.

5. **Concise**: The expert's question is succinct and directly gets to the complex point without unnecessary elaboration, warranting a full score for conciseness.

Overall, the expertâ€™s question scores highly, demonstrating a robust grasp of interlinking climatic and economic datasets to frame a relevant and researchable inquiry into climate policy.
