ANSWER: The expert's question effectively utilizes a broad range of attributes from both Set 1 and Set 2, hence full points were awarded for the usage of these attribute sets. The composition, while ambitious and creative in linking trends in child mortality rates due to injuries with trends in energy production and safety protocols, could potentially stretch practical coherence due to the complex interplay of factors that might independently influence these trends (e.g., healthcare policies, regional safety regulations unrelated to energy infrastructure). Therefore, a slight reduction in points seemed appropriate for Attribute Composition. The question was posed clearly and is answerable with the right dataset, ensuring clarity and confidence get full marks. The question is also well-summarized and concise, thus receiving full points in the Concise criteria. The total points, therefore, sum up to 9 out of a possible 10.
