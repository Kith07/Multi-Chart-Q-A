| Criteria              | Points  |
|-----------------------|---------|
| Attribute Set 1 Info  | 2/2     |
| Attribute Set 2 Info  | 2/2     |
| Attribute Composition | 3.5/4   |
| Clarity/Confidence    | 1/1     |

| **Total Points**      | **9.5/10** |

ANSWER: The expert's question has been graded as follows:

- **Attribute Set 1 Info**: 2/2. The question effectively utilizes a large subset of attributes from the first set. It mentions cumulative CO2 emissions and cumulative emission reductions under a specific Scenario III by 2030, mastering the necessary elements.
- **Attribute Set 2 Info**: 2/2. The question also makes use of a significant portion of data from the second attribute set. It considers cumulative mass loss in gigatonnes specifically in Arctic Canada by 2030.
- **Attribute Composition**: 3.5/4. The expert cleverly connects disparate datasets, examining correlations between CO2 emissions reductions under specific climate strategies and geographic-specific ice mass loss due to climatic factors. The deduction of 0.5 points is due to a slight reach in comprehensively linking these datasets in a way that might easily lend itself to practical, direct comparison; however, the composition is both innovative and thought-provoking.
- **Clarity/Confidence**: 1/1. The question is stated clearly, making it possible to answer provided there is access to precise and comprehensive data. The terminology and structure are professional and understandable.
- **Concise**: 1/1. Despite the complex subject matter, the question is concise and directly to the point, avoiding unnecessary elaboration and focusing exclusively on key points related to the proposed analysis.

In summary, the expert's question is excellently composed, demonstrating substantial thought in connecting climate data for meaningful environmental analysis. The total score reflects the high quality of the inquiry within the specified grading rubric.
