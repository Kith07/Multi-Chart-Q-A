ANSWER:
The grading of the expert's question is based on how effectively it integrates information from two complex attribute sets and formulates a clear, concise, and practical query that can be explored with available or gatherable data.

1. **Attribute Set 1 Info** (Score: 2/2): The question effectively uses aspects of Attribute Set 1 by pinpointing the trend of fossil fuel burning and its impact on CO2 concentration from 1990 to 1998, meeting the requirement of utilizing a significant, though not complete, subset of attributes.

2. **Attribute Set 2 Info** (Score: 2/2): The query includes elements from Attribute Set 2, specifically focusing on afforestation and reforestation as mitigation options and their associated investment costs in developed countries. It overlooks some attributes but centers on major components relevant to the question.

3. **Attribute Composition** (Score: 3/4): The question makes a sophisticated connection by linking the environmental impact data (CO2 increase due to fossil fuel burning) with economic considerations (investment costs of mitigation strategies). Although the linkage uses the attribute sets coherently, it slightly strays by not fully exploring possible direct influences or outcomes between all attribute specifics, which could enrich the complexity and depth of analysis.

4. **Clarity/Confidence** (Score: 1/1): The question is clearly phrased and poses a realistic and valuable investigation into how environmental trends might impact economic strategies, which could be confidently addressed with rigorous data analysis.

5. **Concise** (Score: 1/1): The expert formulated the question in a concise manner, focusing succinctly on the core issue without unnecessary elaboration, which is suited for an academically rigorous or strategic exploration.

Overall, the expert's question scores highly, reflecting its quality and the aptitude in connecting diverse datasets to derive potentially insightful research inquiries.
