ANSWER: The expert's question adeptly integrates the two attribute sets provided. Firstly, Attribute Set 1 that deals with atmospheric CO2 levels (both annual changes and the fraction remaining airborne) is fully considered as the environmental factor affecting health outcomes. Secondly, Attribute Set 2 is employed to check impacts on economic capacities in health services utilization, specifically probing into different payment categories in healthcare facilities. 

In terms of Attribute Composition, the query creates a sensible and innovative bridge between environmental changes and health economics, directly addressing potential variable impacts of increased CO2 levels on healthcare expense categories, and is positioned well within practical research frameworks. 

The question is presented with Clarity/Confidenceâ€”it is succinct, easily understood, and testable with an appropriate methodology and data. The Conciseness is also maintained perfectly, providing a straightforward yet comprehensive exploration potential without undue complexity. Hence, the full scores across all criteria are justified.
