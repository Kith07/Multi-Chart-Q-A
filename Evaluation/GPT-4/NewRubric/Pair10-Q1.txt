ANSWER: The expert's question effectively attempts to interlink the two attribute sets, although it does not fully utilize all the attributes from both sets. In Attribute Set 1, it focuses significantly on the climate scenarios and their related temperature projections but leaves out specific emphasis on the average temperature increase projections for the given decades, which could provide a deeper temporal analysis. From Attribute Set 2, the question incorporates per capita CO2 emissions effectively but less explicitly incorporates the GDP elements, which also play a vital role in understanding economic feedbacks that influence CO2 emissions. However, it effectively connects climate scenarios to regional economic and emissions data, indicating a sophisticated understanding of potential real-world interdependencies.

The question is clearly stated and is potentially answerable with comprehensive data on climate projections and emissions, showing confidence in its formulation. It is concise, focusing on core issues without unnecessary elaboration, which aligns well with the criteria of being brief yet comprehensive.
