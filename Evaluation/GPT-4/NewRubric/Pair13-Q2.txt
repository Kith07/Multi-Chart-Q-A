ANSWER: 
The expert's inference-based question effectively makes use of the attributes from both provided sets. All key components from each set are engaged to construct an analytical query. 

For Attribute Set 1 Info, the expert factored in the fluctuations in production capacity and technology type, hence fully utilizing Set 1, earning a full score.

For Attribute Set 2 Info, the question incorporates the unforced temperature trend effectively. However, it mainly centers on the unforced trend, touching less on the forced trends and the specific time periods; still, the context provided was relevant and well-utilized, granting a full score.

Regarding Attribute Composition, while the question interconnects technology adoption with global temperature trends creatively, the connection could be considered somewhat speculative without noting direct causality or additional correlative data to underpin the hypothesis more firmly. This reliance on assumed correlation deducts one point.

The clarity and confidence of the question are high. The wording is straightforward and the inquiry could potentially be answered with adequate data focusing on the indicated attributes and trends.

The question is also concise, focusing on a specific potential correlation without unnecessary elaboration, making it quite direct and easy to grasp. 

Thus, the overall score is 9 out of 10.
