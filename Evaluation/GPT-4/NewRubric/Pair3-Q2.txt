ANSWER: 
The expert's question scores a total of 7 out of 10 based on the grading rubric. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Attribute Set 1 Info (1/2):** The question mentions only the Ice Volume Anomaly from the first set, overlooking the Ice Thickness Anomaly, hence not fully utilizing the set.

2. **Attribute Set 2 Info (1/2):** From the second set, the question solely focuses on Welfare Variation but does not address GHG Emissions Reductions, Private Households' Consumption, GDP Variation, or Country/Region Indicator, meaning it again does not make full use of the attributes available.

3. **Attribute Composition (3/4):** The expert successfully links attributes from both sets, proposing a connection between Ice Volume Anomaly and Welfare Variation to analyze the impact on living conditions and economic stability in various regions. This linkage is methodologically sound but could have included additional relevant attributes to make an even clearer association between environmental changes and their socio-economic impacts.

4. **Clarity/Confidence (1/1):** The question is indeed clear and could potentially be answered with targeted data collection and analysis, assuming that correlations between ice volume anomalies and welfare in varied regions can be clearly established and quantified.

5. **Concise (1/1):** The question is succinctly phrased and to the point, outlining the scope and intention clearly without unnecessary complexity.

Overall, while the expert's question is insightful and establishes a meaningful connection between two disparate sets of attributes, greater incorporation and engagement with all the given attributes could enhance the depth and breadth of the analysis.
