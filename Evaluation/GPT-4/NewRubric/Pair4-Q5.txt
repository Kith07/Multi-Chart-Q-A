ANSWER:
The expert's question effectively uses the attributes from Set 1 related to productivity per hectare for various crops including rapeseed, as well as those from Set 2 concerning emissions scenarios and reference levels. Here is a breakdown of the scores:

- **Attribute Set 1 Info (2/2)**: The expert's question utilizes rapeseed productivity data well, focusing specifically on its productivity trend over 1961 to 2008. This is a thorough use of the subset relevant for the context of biofuels.
  
- **Attribute Set 2 Info (1.5/2)**: Here, the question specifies the ER-2010 scenario for 2050 emissions. While it incorporates this scenario effectively to consider environmental justification, it disregards other provided scenarios and the specific reference lines for emissions comparisons.
  
- **Attribute Composition (3.5/4)**: The question adeptly connects productivity data of a particular crop with emissions forecasts under a specific scenario to contemplate environmental sustainability and innovation needs for biofuel. This sophisticated linkage aligns well with current concerns about sustainability in biofuel production, though it could incorporate a wider range of scenarios to enrich the analysis.
  
- **Clarity/Confidence (1/1)**: The question is clearly phrased, alluding directly to the data and the inquiry at hand, making it feasible to answer with available or attainable data related to crop yields and scenario-based emission projections.
  
- **Concise (1/1)**: The question is succinctly formulated, focusing sharply on the essential elements of rapeseed productivity and its implications in a specific emissions scenario without unnecessary elaboration.

In summary, the expert demonstrated a strong ability to form a coherent and relevant question by integrating complex datasets from diverse fields, slightly limited by the exclusion of some available data attributes for a possibly richer analysis.
