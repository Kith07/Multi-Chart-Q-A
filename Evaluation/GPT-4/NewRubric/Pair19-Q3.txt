ANSWER: The expert's question effectively integrates a comprehensive understanding of both attribute sets. The question smartly links the trends observed from sea level rise under high emission scenarios with the corresponding increases in cumulative CO2 emissions, highlighting a significant correlation under environmentally impactful conditions. The expert also extends this discussion to the implications for global strategies, thus demonstrating a deep appreciation for how these two datasets interact and reflect bigger picture climate issues. 

- **Attribute Set 1 Info**: The question effectively uses the detailed attributes of sea level rises under various scenarios from Set 1, particularly focusing on high emission scenarios which are central to the inference made.
- **Attribute Set 2 Info**: The expert proficiently incorporates the attribute information on cumulative emissions of CO2 associated with high levels of CO2 from Set 2, which is necessary for the argument construction.
- **Attribute Composition**: The composition goes beyond listing attributes by correlating increased levels of CO2 and the resultant global warming effects manifesting as sea level rises, illustrating a sophisticated understanding of the interdependencies.
- **Clarity/Confidence**: The question articulates a clear relationship between the environmental factors discussed and poses a plausible inquiry that can be answered given appropriate data on these metrics.
- **Concise**: Although the question is multi-dimensional, it is succinctly phrase, making it an excellent use of expert language to condense complex relationships into a single, concise query.

Overall, the expert earns a perfect score on the given rubric, reflecting their prowess in synthesizing and posing relevant, insightful questions grounded in their subject expertise.
