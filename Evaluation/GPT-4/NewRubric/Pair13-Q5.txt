ANSWER: The expert's question effectively utilizes a large subset of the attributes from both sets. All critical attributes like technology types, production capacity, years, and forced temperature trends are acknowledged, which justify full scores in these categories (2/2 for both Attribute Set 1 Info and Attribute Set 2 Info).

In Attribute Composition, it earns a 3/4 because although the question intriguingly connects technology-specific capacities with forced temperature trends under a climate policy framework, the direct linkage between these attributes might require substantial elucidation or assumptions given that relationship between technology types in energy production and climate modeling is complex and multifactorial. This slight reduction is due to potential complexities in making a direct correlation without additional contextual data or assumptions.

Clarity and Conciseness both score perfectly (1/1) as the question is presented in a clear, direct manner and stays concise while encapsulating complex multidisciplinary relationships, which demonstrates the expert's ability to synthesize complex scenarios succinctly.

Overall, the expert's question is highly thought-provoking, making intricate links between disparate datasets to propose a meaningful inquiry into policy decision-making based on technological impacts on climate trends.
