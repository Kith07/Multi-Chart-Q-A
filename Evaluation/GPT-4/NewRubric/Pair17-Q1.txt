ANSWER: The expert's question makes use of a significant amount of the provided attributes from both sets, attempting to establish a connection between sea level rise data (from Set 1) and vaccination rates (from Set 2). This inter-disciplinary connection is sophisticated and demonstrates an innovative approach to linking environmental changes with health outcomes.

1. **Attribute Set 1 Info (1/2)**: The question mainly focuses on the solid and dashed black lines (likely representing standard data and a model or different parameter set), which form just a part of the entire first attribute set.
2. **Attribute Set 2 Info (1/2)**: The question mentions specific doses of the PCV vaccine but does not incorporate the Rotavirus doses or the temporal (month) axis in detail. 
3. **Attribute Composition (3/4)**: The composition of attributes from different disciplinary fields to formulate a coherent research question is commendable. It misses a full score as it could delve deeper into how these datasets interact over the same temporal scales and perhaps could have explained why particular vaccine doses were chosen.
4. **Clarity/Confidence (1/1)**: The question is clearly stated and directs toward a specific research inquiry that could be investigated given appropriate data regarding sea level impact on public health logistics or accessibility.
5. **Concise (1/1)**: The query is concise, focused, and directly addresses the potential interaction of seemingly unrelated data sets without unnecessary elaboration.

Overall, the expert has made an intriguing attempt at cross-disciplinary analysis, scoring 7 out of 10 points on the given rubric. This indicates a strong, though not fully optimized, use of the provided data attributes in forming a meaningful, research-oriented question.
