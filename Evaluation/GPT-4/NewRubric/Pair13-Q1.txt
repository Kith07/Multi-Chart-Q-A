ANSWER: The expert's question effectively utilizes a large subset of attributes from both Set 1 and Set 2, meriting full points in the first two criteria sections. Regarding attribute composition, the question presents a sophisticated linkage between solar energy production capacity (from Set 1) and its potential impact on mitigating forced temperature trends (from Set 2). However, the direct influence of solar production from a specific technology in a single year on a broader climatic trend over a 30-year period requires assumptions about scalability and impact that could slightly reduce practicality, thus 3/4 points were awarded.

The question is presented in a clear and confident manner, suggesting that it could feasibly be answered with sufficient data. It is also concise, summarizing a complex relationship in a straightforward manner without unnecessary details. Thus, full points were given in both the clarity/confidence and conciseness categories, leading to a high total score of 9 out of 10.
