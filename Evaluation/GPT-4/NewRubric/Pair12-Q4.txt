Grading Rubric:

| Criteria              | Points |
|-----------------------|--------|
| Attribute Set 1 Info  | 1/2    |
| Attribute Set 2 Info  | 2/2    |
| Attribute Composition | 3/4    |

| Concise               | 1/1    |
| **Total Points**      | **8/10** |

ANSWER: Letâ€™s break down the scoring:

- **Attribute Set 1 Info (1/2)**: The expert's question utilizes the gender-specific life expectancy disparities element from Set 1, but it does not explicitly mention year or include specific trends from the 1990-2013 period. This partial utilization results in a score of 1 out of 2.

- **Attribute Set 2 Info (2/2)**: The question effectively incorporates information from Set 2 by mentioning both precipitation and temperature changes in the Arctic, as well as the variability indicated by the shaded confidence intervals. This comprehensive use warrants a full score.

- **Attribute Composition (3/4)**: The expert creatively intertwines the disparate themes of climate-induced health impacts and gender-specific life expectancy in Norwegian healthcare policies. Though the connection between these attribute sets is sophisticated and mostly practical, the link between specific climatic effects and gender disparities in health could be seen as slightly forced or less direct, resulting in a score reduction.

- **Clarity/Confidence (1/1)**: The question posed is clear and could be researched with available data concerning climate changes and health outcomes, fulfilling the criteria for clarity and potential confidence in the results.

- **Concise (1/1)**: The question is succinct and well-summarized, effectively communicating the query without unnecessary elaboration, thus achieving full points for conciseness.

This scoring reflects a solid attempt by the expert to integrate two complex sets of data in a meaningful and researchable way, despite some challenges in completely linking the effects of climate change directly to gender-specific life expectancy disparities.
