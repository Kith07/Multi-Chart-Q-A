ANSWER: Here's a detailed breakdown of the points awarded:

- **Attribute Set 1 Info (2/2):** The expert's question makes direct reference to life expectancy which is a crucial element from Set 1. Given this direct reference and its integration with climate data from Set 2, full points are awarded.

- **Attribute Set 2 Info (2/2):** The question effectively uses information about precipitation changes and their variability (as indicated by the shaded areas of confidence intervals), also provided in Set 2. Hence, full points are justified here.

- **Attribute Composition (3/4):** The connection between climate data and life expectancy, emphasizing the potential health impacts of climate variations, is intriguing and generally sophisticated. However, the leap from climate data directly influencing life expectancy could be seen as slightly overreaching without intermediate data (e.g., public health data, demographic adjustments). Therefore, most points are awarded, but not full due to this slight stretch.

- **Clarity/Confidence (1/1):** The question is posed clearly and can be addressed with a comprehensive analytical approach using climate and health data. Therefore, it warrants full points for this criterion.

- **Concise (1/1):** The question is concisely stated, focusing on core issues without unnecessary elaboration, thereby warranting a full score in this category.

Overall, the expert's question scores highly on the rubric, with particularly strong performance in clarity, conciseness, and appropriate use of the given attribute sets. The slight deduction in attribute composition reflects the challenge of bridging distinct domains (climate science and health impacts) directly without intermediary factors, yet it remains a commendably framed question.
