ANSWER:
The expert's question adeptly incorporates most attributes from both the provided attribute sets. For Attribute Set 1 Info, the expert utilizes all elements effectively, addressing Year, Production Capacity, and Technology Type romantically linked to changes between specific years. This earns a full score of 2/2. 

Although the question logically connects to Attribute Set 2 Info, it somewhat neglects specifics like the "Unforced Temperature Trend", focusing instead predominantly on the "Forced Temperature Trend" and its implications in the mentioned time period, thus the score is 1/2.

In terms of Attribute Composition, the expert masterfully builds a coherent question that connects technological advancements in solar energy with projected climatic changes due to human activities. This sophisticated linkage fully deserves a score of 4/4, indicating the expert did not simply use attributes as a checklist but rather combined them meaningfully.

The expertâ€™s question is clear and confident, providing a well-framed inquiry that can be addressed with data, thus scoring 1/1. Its concise nature, avoiding unnecessary elaboration while maintaining comprehensiveness, equally warrants a full score of 1/1.

Overall, the total points awarded amount to 9 out of 10, reflecting a highly commendable inquiry formulation by the expert.
