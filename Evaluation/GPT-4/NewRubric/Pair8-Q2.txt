ANSWER:
The expert's question effectively utilizes attributes from both given sets. The selected attributes from Set 1, which involve different biomes and their carbon stocks across various timestamps, are used fully, reflecting a full utilization and receiving a score of 2/2. Similarly, from Set 2, while the question does not specify which institutions might facilitate funding, it assumes a generic capability of development banks to intervene, thus still making significant use of the information provided about the role of development banks, scoring a 2/2.

The question scores a 3/4 in Attribute Composition. It creates a sophisticated connection between the impact of biome carbon stock changes over time and the role that strategic funding could have on influencing these biomes positively. However, the linkage, while practical, could be deeper by specifying forms of research or conservation efforts or particularities on how development banks could structurally support these efforts.

In terms of Clarity and Confidence, the question is framed clearly and assumes availability of data or research to answer it, deserving a 1/1. Similarly, it is concise enough to provoke a thought without becoming overly elaborate, earning it another 1/1.

Thus, the total score for the expert's question stands commendably at 9 out of 10.
