ANSWER:
The grading of the expert's inference-based question is based on how well they utilized and connected the two sets of attributes:

1. **Attribute Set 1 Info**: The question uses a large subset of attributes from Set 1, particularly focusing on Global CO2 Emissions and the Baseline scenario, but it does not incorporate every aspect such as different scenario types or specific emissions reduction strategies. Hence, a score of 1.5/2.

2. **Attribute Set 2 Info**: The question covers the Warm Spells attribute from Set 2 adequately, establishing a direct inquiry into its frequency, but it doesn't cover other variables such as Cold Spells or Heat Wave Magnitude Index directly. Therefore, similarly, it scores 1.5/2.

3. **Attribute Composition**: The expert impressively ties the increase in CO2 emissions (Set 1) to potential changes in Warm Spells (Set 2), indicating a well-thought-out relation of how climate changes could manifest as direct environmental impacts. The question also subtly nudges at implications for adaptation strategies, suggesting a practical approach to dealing with projected changes. Therefore, it scores 3.5/4.

4. **Clarity/Confidence**: The question is clear, well-phrased, and with enough data, typically collected from environmental observations and emission projection models, it would be answerable with a fair degree of confidence. It earns a full 1/1 here.

5. **Concise**: The question is succinct, fairly straightforward, and not verbose, focusing directly on the linkage of emissions to climate-induced phenomena and its broader implications. It scores 1/1 for being concise.

In total, the expert's question scores an 8.5/10, reflecting a strong, relevant, and well-constructed inquiry into the potential climatic impacts of trending global CO2 emissions under specific scenarios, though it could enhance by including a broader range of related attributes for a more comprehensive analysis.
