Grading Rubric:

| Criteria               | Points |
|------------------------|--------|
| Attribute Set 1 Info   | 2/2    |
| Attribute Set 2 Info   | 2/2    |
| Attribute Composition  | 3/4    |
| Clarity/Confidence     | 1/1    |

| **Total Points**       | **9/10** |

ANSWER: The expert's question scores highly across all the grading criteria, which reflects a sophisticated and well-thought-out approach to linking the information provided by the two attribute sets. Here's the detailed analysis based on the scoring rubric:

1. **Attribute Set 1 Info (2/2)**: The question effectively utilizes information on productivity per hectare of sugarcane between 1961 and 2008. Though it does not specifically mention crop types for other specified crops, the focus remains relevantly linked to sugarcane, fully leveraging this component of the attributes.

2. **Attribute Set 2 Info (2/2)**: The question appropriately uses the 2050 projections from the IEA-WEO2009-Baseline scenario, clearly integrating this specific attribute into the inquiry.

3. **Attribute Composition (3/4)**: The expert notably links two very distinct sets of data - Crop productivity and CO2 emissions under various scenarios. The connection made considers environmental implications and sustainable practices which demonstrate an innovative approach to cross-disciplinary inference. The deduction of implications for agricultural sustainability based on CO2 emission scenarios introduces a slight stretch, which though innovative, might somewhat exceed the practical immediacy and coherence given the indirect relationship between these attributes.

4. **Clarity/Confidence (1/1)**: The question is formulated clearly and can be answered definitively, assuming access to the necessary data, especially detailed analyses comparing historical agricultural data with predicted environmental data. It poses a genuine inquiry into how one might influence the other, reflecting confidence in the potential findings.

5. **Concise (1/1)**: Despite the complexity of connecting two diverse data sets, the question remains concise and to the point, effectively summarizing the essential components required for a reasonable analysis without diverting into unnecessary details.

Overall, the high score reflects the expert's ability to thoughtfully and effectively synthesize complex, multidisciplinary data into a clear, concise, and meaningful question.
