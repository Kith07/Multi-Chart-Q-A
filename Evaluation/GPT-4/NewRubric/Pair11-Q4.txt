ANSWER: The expert's question effectively utilizes both sets of attributes described in the introduction. In scoring each category:

- **Attribute Set 1 Info**: The expert fully deploys data about "Deaths per 100,000" and the timeline ("Year") in taking into account health outcomes over time. Thus, the full score of 2/2 is allocated.

- **Attribute Set 2 Info**: The expert incorporates the "Response Index" and "Group Labels (I, II, III, V, VI)", which intricately ties into the expert's discussion on policy measures in the energy sector. Since "Importance of Energy Efficiency vs. Carbon Efficiency" is also inferred in the context, the full score of 2/2 is given.

- **Attribute Composition**: The expert made a sophisticated linkage between public health metrics and energy policy impacts from a systems perspective. However, the presentation possibly assumes undemonstrated or speculative causality between energy policies and health outcomes which might underpin a slight reduction in the score for ultimate coherence of attribute connection, resulting in a score of 3/4.

- **Clarity/Confidence** and **Concise**: The question is framed clearly, allowing for a straightforward hypothetical investigation based on available data. The query is also concise, communicating a complex interdisciplinary question succinctly, deserving full points in both categories, 1/1 each.

Overall, the question scores high as it exhibits a deep understanding and analytical approach to connecting different data aspects, only slightly falling short in fully substantiating the implied causation between energy policy and health impacts.
