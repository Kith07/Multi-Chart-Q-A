ANSWER: The expert's question effectively utilizes information from both attribute sets, making strong connections between changes in CO2 and O2 concentrations and the mitigative measures related to forestry in coastal regions. It encompasses a large subset of details from both sets, particularly highlighting elements such as ocean uptake from the first attribute set and carbon sequestration activities by type along with mitigation potential from the second set. Furthermore, the expert combines these aspects into a coherent and sophisticated question that probes into practical environmental and economic implications. The question wording is clear, indicating that it can be answered with appropriate data, and it remains concise and focused, providing enough detail without becoming overly elaborate. Hence, a perfect score is warranted.
