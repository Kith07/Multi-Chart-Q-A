ANSWER: The expert's question has been graded based on the provided criteria as follows:

- **Attribute Set 1 Info (1/2):** The question partially utilizes the information from Attribute Set 1. It clearly incorporates aspects related to locations and staffing targets but does not weave in how the number of staff might be influenced directly by climatic factors, which might be less obvious or straightforward without additional clarification or data.

- **Attribute Set 2 Info (2/2):** The question effectively utilizes a large subset of the attributes from Set 2, particularly focusing on the leaf unfolding of birch and horse chestnut along with early spring temperatures, which are fundamental data points to the provided inference.

- **Attribute Composition (3/4):** The question skillfully connects ecological data with healthcare workload predictions, indicative of a sophisticated understanding and novel application of the data sets. However, the leap between ecological/climatic parameters and healthcare staffing is ambitious and might require more explicit bridging data or assumptions to completely solidify this connection.

- **Clarity/Confidence (1/1):** The question is clearly stated and posits a relationship that, with appropriate data, could be investigated with confidence regarding the impact of climatic conditions on healthcare demand, especially during critical allergy seasons.

- **Concise (1/1):** The inquiry is concisely formulated, straightforward, and avoids unnecessary complexity in its wording, allowing for focused research or investigation.

Overall, the expert's question demonstrates a thoughtful and innovative attempt to link disparate datasets in a meaningful way, considering climatic effects on healthcare service demands which is reflective in the total score of 8 out of 10.
