ANSWER: The expert's question does a commendable job of integrating both attribute sets provided, which is reflected in the scores for 'Attribute Set 1 Info' and 'Attribute Set 2 Info'. Each attribute from both sets seems to have been acknowledged, with the focus on the primary independent and dependent variables. 'Attribute Composition' earns a 3/4 because the question sets up a sophisticated connection between emissions data from geothermal technologies and investment trends in hydropower. This comparative analysis is practical and coherent, though the direct correlation setup could be slightly difficult to track given the difference in the types of data (investment vs. emissions).

Clarity and confidence of the proposed question are high; the question is formulated in a way that can be empirically researched given adequate data. The question is also concise, summarizing complex relationships without dragging into unnecessary detail, meriting a full score on conciseness. Overall, the expert's question scores an impressive 9 out of 10, reflecting a well-thought-out approach to integrating these two distinct environmental data sets.
