ANSWER: The expert's question effectively utilizes the provided attributes from both sets, incorporating significant elements such as the radiative forcing levels and the interaction between these levels and scenario categories under different climate models. The question specifically references the BERN2.5CC standard version and the A1FI scenario, which are pertinent to understanding the impacts of high radiative forcing on global temperature increases in high economic growth scenarios. This demonstrates a deep and coherent connection between the attributes, satisfying the composition criterion fully.

The question is clearly stated, focusing on a specific aspect of the data (radiative forcing at 4.5 W/m^2 during 2075 to 2100) and its impact under specific models and scenarios. This clarity and specificity make the question answerable with sufficient data, thus scoring full points for clarity/confidence.

Furthermore, the question is concise and to the point, avoiding unnecessary elaboration while still being comprehensive enough to construct a meaningful analysis. This concise nature ensures that the question meets the criteria for being summarized effectively.

Thus, the expert's question scores a full 10 out of 10 on the grading rubric, demonstrating a well-constructed inquiry into the complex interactions of climate model predictions.
