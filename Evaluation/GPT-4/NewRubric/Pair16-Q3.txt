ANSWER: The expert's question effectively utilizes information from both attribute sets regarding hydropower investments and geothermal technology GHG emissions. While the question draws substantially from both sets, it deeply integrates them by comparing the sustainability of two different energy technologies potentially impacted by investment trends. However, scoring slightly lower in 'Attribute Composition' is primarily because the indirect linkage between investment scales and GHG emissions could benefit from a more explicit or detailed analytical perspective in the context the question is asked. Beyond that, the question is clear, allowing for a specific analysis based on the provided data, and it remains concise without unnecessary complication or elaboration.
