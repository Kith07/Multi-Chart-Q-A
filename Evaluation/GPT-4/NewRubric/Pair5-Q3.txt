ANSWER:
The question devised by the expert effectively utilizes attributes from both set 1 and set 2, managing to include a substantive amount from each set. In set 1, the question highlights the cumulative emission reductions and integrates them with the cumulative climatic mass balance from set 2, demonstrating the ability to bridge data between emission reductions and geographic climatic conditions effectively. This composition not only links the independent variables from both sets but also astutely connects these to a significant environmental outcome, making the connection sophisticated yet practically coherent.

The question's clarity and precision are commendable, as it succinctly encapsulates the intent to explore correlations between global emission control strategies and localized glacier volume changes, without unnecessary elaboration or ambiguity. It is constructed in a manner that can be clearly understood and translated into a research question or hypothesis testing scenario given adequate data. This clarity and conciseness ought to facilitate straightforward research design and data analysis towards answering the question. Thus, it scores full points across all categories in the rubric.
