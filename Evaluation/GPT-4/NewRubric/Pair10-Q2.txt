ANSWER:

The expert's compositional question scores a high 9 out of 10 based on the grading criteria outlined. Here's a detailed breakdown of the scoring:

1. **Attribute Set 1 Info: 2/2** - The question effectively utilizes a broad range of relevant attributes from Set 1, specifically referencing the climate scenarios and projected temperature increases across different decades. It also implicitly connects these scenarios with the impacts that could be observed regionally, thus addressing the global warming projections comprehensively.

2. **Attribute Set 2 Info: 2/2** - The attributes from Set 2 are well integrated, with explicit references to cumulative population growth and its implications on CO2 emissions per capita. The reference to regional economic activities presents a nuanced understanding of how demographics and economics interplay with emissions.

3. **Attribute Composition: 3/4** - The question cleverly stitches together the attributes from both sets, discussing how demographic trends (population growth) and climate scenarios might affect CO2 emissions per capita in specific regions. Although profound, the question might have slightly improved by explicitly incorporating economic performance from Set 2 to give a more direct connection to economic outputs and GHG efficiency noted in the attribute explanations.

4. **Clarity/Confidence: 1/1** - The question posed is clear and straightforward, providing a logical pathway that can reasonably be explored given adequate data and analysis tools. It's articulated in a way that invites empirical examination and forecast modeling.

5. **Concise: 1/1** - The question is concise, posing a complex scenario in a digestible format without redundant elements or excessive elaboration, making it well-suited for a focused analysis.

Overall, the expert has formulated a robust, insightful, and accessible inquiry that effectively leverages and synthesizes a complex array of data attributes to explore critical trends in climate science and socio-economics.
