ANSWER:
The expert's question effectively uses a large subset of attributes from both Set 1 and Set 2, meriting a full score in the first two criteria. By inquiring about the relationship between regional GHG emission policies and changes in ice volume and thickness anomalies, while considering economic and welfare impacts, the expert demonstrates a sophisticated connection between the environmental data and socio-economic indicators. However, the connection could be slightly clearer regarding how indicators like GDP and Welfare Variation specifically correlate directly with ice measurements, slightly reducing the score in Attribute Composition. The question is presented clearly and succinctly, allowing for potential research or analysis to be carried out effectively, thus earning full points in Clarity/Confidence and Conciseness.
