ANSWER: The expert's question scores a total of 8 points out of 10 based on the designated rubric. Here’s a breakdown of the scores:

1. **Attribute Set 1 Info**: The question makes partial use of the first attribute set by focusing on scenarios that influence sea-level rise, but does not explicitly incorporate all elements such as the variability bands or directly referencing the different scenario lines. Hence, it receives 1 out of 2.

2. **Attribute Set 2 Info**: The expert effectively utilizes the relationship between equilibrium pCO2 and changes in pH (ΔpH), which are both crucial components of the second attribute set. The reference to implications on ocean acidity directly calls upon these attributes, earning 1.5 out of 2 points.

3. **Attribute Composition**: The question successfully integrates the two sets of attributes in a meaningful way, exploring the implications of rising sea levels on ocean acidity and further impacts on marine life and coastal ecosystems. It clearly proposes a sophisticated connection between climatic scenarios and biochemical changes. Therefore, it receives 3.5 out of 4 points.

4. **Clarity/Confidence**: The expert's question is clear and structured in a way that could be confidently answered with sufficient data. It is specific in its inquiry about future implications and thus earns a full 1 out of 1.

5. **Concise**: The question is concise and to the point, without unnecessary elaboration while still being comprehensive in its coverage of the issue. It earns 1 out of 1 in this category.

The total score reflects a well-formulated and insightful question that could effectively guide meaningful analysis in environmental and ecological studies.
