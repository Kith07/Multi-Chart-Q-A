ANSWER:
The expert's question effectively utilizes the information from both attribute sets. Specifically, the question connects the variability and uncertainties from different scenarios of sea level rise and CO2 emissions, which are central elements in the provided data sets. This demonstrates a comprehensive understanding and integration of the datasets linked to critical global issues, hence scoring full points in the 'Attribute Set 1 Info' and 'Attribute Set 2 Info'.

In terms of 'Attribute Composition', the question skillfully bridges the two different environmental impacts (sea level rise and CO2 emissions) and their underlying scientific measures, reflecting sophisticated understanding and applicability. This goes beyond merely listing attributes, hence the full score in this category.

The query is also articulated clearly, allowing for a potential answer given adequate data, thus achieving a full score in 'Clarity/Confidence'. Finally, the question is succinct and focused without unnecessary complexity, deserving a full point for conciseness. The total perfect score reflects a very well-conceived and articulated question by the expert.
