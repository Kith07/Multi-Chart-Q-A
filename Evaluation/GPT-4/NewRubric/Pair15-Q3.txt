ANSWER: The expert's question effectively uses a large subset of attributes from both Set 1 and Set 2, fully integrating and interpreting the importance of emission scenarios and gender-specific health data, hence the full scores for 'Attribute Set 1 Info' and 'Attribute Set 2 Info'. The 'Attribute Composition' is sophisticated as it aims to link climate scenarios with healthcare impacts, making thoughtful connections between environmental factors and health. However, it slightly lacks a direct method of utilizing the attribute data to bridge these fields practically, hence a score of 3/4. The question is clear and concise, which is reflected in full scores for 'Clarity/Confidence' and 'Concise'. The total score reflects high effectiveness in crafting an interdisciplinary question though slightly improving practical linkage could enhance it.
