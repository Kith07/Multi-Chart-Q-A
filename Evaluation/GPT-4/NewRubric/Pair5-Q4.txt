ANSWER: The expert's question effectively leverages a significant portion of both attribute sets. Despite the complexity between the emission scenarios and geographic-specific climate responses, the question plausibly connects emission scenarios with glacial mass balance in a geographically contextualized manner. This showcases a sophisticated understanding and practical use of the data. Additionally, the question is clear, suggesting that with the right data, a definite answer could be deduced. It remains concise, summarizing a complex interaction in a single sentence without unnecessary elaboration. Thus, the full marks reflect the expert's adept handling of the topic within the constraints of the available data and attribute sets.
