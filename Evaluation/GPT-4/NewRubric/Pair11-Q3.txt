ANSWER: In evaluating the expert's inference-based question according to the designated scoring rubric, the following points are noted:

1. **Attribute Set 1 Info** - The question effectively utilizes the information from Set 1, which focuses on the years and associated deaths per 100,000. The use of this data set is critical in trying to establish a timeline and measure the impacts, thus fully meeting the criteria.

2. **Attribute Set 2 Info** - The expert also incorporates elements from Set 2 adequately by referencing the Group Labels and importance of energy efficiency vs. carbon efficiency. The question successfully incorporates these elements to shape the inquiry about policy impacts, aligning fully with the set.

3. **Attribute Composition** - The question attempts to link the mortality rates (from Set 1) with policy focuses on carbon efficiency (from Set 2). This composition is sophisticated and initiates a complex discussion about correlations between public health and energy policy. However, it slightly lacks in providing a clear method to verify the composition, which discounts the score slightly from a perfect composition score.

4. **Clarity/Confidence** - The question is stated clearly and directs focus towards a potential correlation that could be investigated with additional data concerning actual policy implementation details and health impact studies, thus attaining full points.

5. **Concise** - The expert's question is concise and to the point, effectively summarizing a complex inquiry in one sentence, thereby earning full marks in this category.

Overall, the expert's question is well-formed and thought-provoking, scoring a high mark on the rubric. It thoughtfully connects disparate sets of data attributes to explore an interdisciplinary and relevant aspect of energy policies in relation to public health.
