ANSWER: The expert's question adeptly utilizes information from both attribute sets. It asks for an analysis that bridges data from sea level rise projections under a low-emission scenario (B1) with changes in pH levels under similarly low pCO2 conditions from the second attribute set. This shows a sophisticated connection between climate impact (sea level rise), atmospheric conditions (CO2 concentrations), and ocean chemistry changes (pH levels), warranting a full score in Attribute Composition.

Both attribute sets are represented well in the question, ensuring complete use of the key variables for both sea level rise and equilibrium pCO2. Each set's main aspects are incorporated into the question, meriting full marks for both Attribute Set 1 Info and Attribute Set 2 Info.

The question also scores high on clarity and conciseness. It frames a complex inquiry in a straightforward manner, making it not only clear what is being asked but also ensuring it can be comprehensively addressed given adequate data. The question is succinct, directly linking the impacts and strategies in a concise query without unnecessary elaboration, thus facilitating focused analysis and discussion.
