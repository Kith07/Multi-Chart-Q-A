ANSWER: The expert’s question articulately ties together data from two seemingly unrelated datasets: childhood mortality from various disease categories and the annual deployment of renewable energy projects. Here’s the breakdown of each criterion:

- **Attribute Set 1 Info:** The question covers all three disease categories but omits direct reference to the specific age categories, which could provide deeper insight into the correlations at different developmental stages.
- **Attribute Set 2 Info:** The question effectively incorporates year, number of projects, and indirectly references energy infrastructure scale and output which might influence public health indirectly through environmental and economic impacts.
- **Attribute Composition:** It excellently connects energy policy and health outcomes, suggesting an advanced understanding of public health and sustainable development's interdisciplinary nature. This bridges social implications with infrastructural changes.
- **Clarity/Confidence:** The question posed is clearly articulated, showing that it could be answered through specific analytics and targeted data studies examining links between energy access, environmental health, and child mortality.
- **Concise:** The question is succinct and directly queries the relationship between these critical areas, indicating an ability to distill complex data interconnections into a potent, researchable query.

Overall, the question is keenly crafted, reflecting an integrated view of public health and renewable energy, and almost perfectly using the provided attributes to underscore significant societal issues.
