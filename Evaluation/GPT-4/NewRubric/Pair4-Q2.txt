ANSWER:
The expert's question effectively uses information from both attribute sets. It incorporates data on the increase in maize productivity over time (attribute set 1) and the CO2 emissions forecasts for 2030 under specific scenarios (attribute set 2). This demonstrates a sophisticated connection between agricultural productivity and environmental impact, addressing both economic and ecological dimensions, which aligns with the 'Attribute Composition' criteria.

The query is clear and can confidently be responded to with available agricultural and environmental data and technologies, thereby fulfilling the 'Clarity/Confidence' criteria. It also succinctly ties these complex ideas together in a brief question format, which meets the 'Concise' criterion.

Overall, the inclusion and integration of all given components, plus the directive nature of the question about future actions, indicate a well-constructed inquiry deserving of a full score according to the provided rubric.
