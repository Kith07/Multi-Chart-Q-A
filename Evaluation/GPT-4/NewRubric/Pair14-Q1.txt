ANSWER: The expert's question effectively uses a large subset of attributes from both Attribute Set 1 and Set 2, effectively fulfilling the criteria with full scores in those sections. 

In relation to Attribute Composition, the question does a reasonably sophisticated job of linking attributes from both sets, attempting a complex interaction between aerosols, cloud formation, and climate patterns indicated by NINO 3 anomalies during specific climatic events like El Niño years. However, the connection could be slightly clearer especially in explaining how the environmental variations specific to El Niño years could impact the interaction between aerosols and cloud formation. This area was somewhat less concrete, thus a deduction was made.

The question maintains clarity and confidence, proposing a clear and answerable inquiry assuming the availability of relevant data. It is concise, without unnecessary elaboration, focusing directly on the core of the investigative hypothesis. The brevity and directness of the question allow easy understanding and response without loss in the specificity needed for scientific inquiry.
