ANSWER: The expert's question scores highly in terms of using both sets of attribute information effectively. Each set incorporates large subsets of the available attributes, earning full points in these categories. However, the attribute composition scores lower, as the connection between life expectancy data in Norway and temperature changes in the Arctic across specific months, while imaginative and potentially revealing, might stretch practical or direct correlation without additional contextual or theoretical grounding. Clarity and conciseness of the question are excellent, with the query posed in a straightforward and manageable manner, facilitating focused analysis assuming appropriate data is available. Overall, the question is well-formulated but could benefit from a sharper focus on direct causative relationships or clearer hypotheses concerning the linkage between climate changes and health impacts.
