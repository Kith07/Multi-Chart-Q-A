ANSWER: The expert carefully intertwined significant elements from both attribute sets to formulate a meaningful and cohesive question. By probing the potential relationship between energy stability (as suggested by capacity factors) and healthcare outcomes in early childhood, specifically looking at mortality due to non-communicable diseases, the expert successfully uses data from both domains to pose an innovative hypothesis. The question effectively employs attributes from both sets: it uses 'Years' and 'Capacity Factor (%)' from the first set and relates them to mortality rates from the second set. The clarity and succinctness of the question ensure that it is both informative and achievable, assuming adequate data availability. Moreover, the concise packaging of complex interdependencies in a single query preserves the essence without over-complicating the inquiry, scoring full marks across all criteria in the provided grading rubric.
