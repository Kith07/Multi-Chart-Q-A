ANSWER: Here's the breakdown of the grading based on the criteria provided:

- **Attribute Set 1 Info**:
  The expert's question effectively uses all the key components of Attribute Set 1, engaging with life expectancy trends which involve gender differences and the time span of observed years effectively.

- **Attribute Set 2 Info**:
  The question efficiently incorporates information from Attribute Set 2, discussing climatic changes in terms of drastic shifts in temperature and precipitation, which aligns with the attributes of precipitation change, temperature change, and time provided in the set.

- **Attribute Composition**:
  The expert creates a compelling connection between the two attribute sets, exploring how climatic changes might correlate with shifts in life expectancy trends. The question scores slightly lower here only because while the connection is thoughtful, the practical execution of correlating these specific events (especially across different data types and scales) adds complexity that might hinder straightforward analysis.

- **Clarity/Confidence**:
  The question is clearly phrased and posits a hypothesis that could potentially be tested with detailed data on weather events and health outcomes, assuming such comprehensive data is accessible for the same years and regions.

- **Concise**:
  The question is concise and clearly communicates its objectives without unnecessary complexity, allowing for focused investigation.

Thus, the expert's question receives a high total score of 9 out of 10, reflecting its well-thought-out nature and the insightful connections it attempts to draw between climatic factors and health metrics.
