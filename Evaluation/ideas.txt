1. Impose a stricter regular grading/evaluation rubric to improve refinement and help produce high-quality and meaningful questions

2. Craft high-quality manual responses. Have a target response thatâ€™s a good answer to a question. Prompt the LLM on similarity between the actual
   and target response on another rubric, this time on a scale of 0 to 10, and set a threshold for passing

3. Feed the final grading score/explanation back to the LLM for fine-tuning based on reinforcement learning?


TO_DO:

1. Caclulate similarity for pairwise charts (Find poor pairs to test out rubric)  -- DONE
2. Improve weightage of the composition criteria -- DONE
3. Evaluate the questions with the new rubric
4. Test with 100 Questions (Generation + Evaluation)

Questions have to be 5 per pair and need not have to hit every single attribute but maintain utility -- DONE
Change rubric to mention practicality over simply hitting attributes from both charts -- DONE
