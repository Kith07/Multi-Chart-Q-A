Chart 2064:

**Identified Attributes:**

1. **Time (Ma)** - Horizontal axis across all sections.
2. **Atmospheric CO2 (ppm)** - Vertical axis in the top and bottom sections.
3. **Continental glaciation (° palaeolatitude)** - Secondary vertical axis in the top section.
4. **Deep Ocean Temperature (°C)** - Vertical axis in the middle section.
5. **CO2 Proxies** - Various lines/bars representing different methods (e.g., Stomata, Phytoplankton, Boron).
6. **Geochemical Models** - Area representing plausible ranges of CO2 based on models (e.g., GEOCARB III).
7. **Isotope Values (‰ 18O)** - Vertical axis in the middle section, represented by line data points.
8. **Data layers** - Different colored sections in the plots indicating ranges, averages, or types of data.

**Visualization Explanation:**

1. **Time (Ma)** - Represented on the horizontal axis, spanning from 400 million years ago to the present.
2. **Atmospheric CO2 (ppm)** - Displayed on the vertical axis in both the top and bottom sections with line plots showing CO2 levels across time.
3. **Continental glaciation (° palaeolatitude)** - Shown as vertical blue bars on the right side of the top section, indicating ice sheet extents at various times.
4. **Deep Ocean Temperature (°C)** - Presented with a dark line plot, indicating temperature changes over the same time frame.
5. **CO2 Proxies** - Illustrated with distinct colored lines/bars for each method (Stomata, Phytoplankton, Boron) across the top and bottom sections.
6. **Geochemical Models** - Plotted as shaded areas and lines overlaid in the top and bottom sections, depicting model predictions of CO2 levels.
7. **Isotope Values (‰ 18O)** - Indicated by a black line and data points in the middle section, reflecting changes in isotope values corresponding to glaciation.
8. **Data layers** - Visualized through a combination of colors and shaded areas in the plots, representing variability and confidence in the data.
