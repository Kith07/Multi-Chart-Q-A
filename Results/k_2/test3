Question: 

Considering the increase in Storm Track activity over North-West Europe as detailed in Figure 9.30, and the comprehensive coupled climate models projecting the evolution of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) depicted in Figure 10.15., what likely impact will the changes in greenhouse gas scenarios, along with alterations in the MOC, have on storm formation and intensity in North-West Europe throughout the 21st century? Could they result in an increased frequency and/or intensity of storms, and if so, does the simulation data provide a quantitative degree of confidence for such a correlation considering the potential limitations and inconsistencies within the current models?
