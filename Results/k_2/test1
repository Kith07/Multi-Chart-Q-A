Question: 

Analyze the relationship between the increasing storm track activity over north-west Europe as depicted in Figure 9.30 and the evolution of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC) from Figure 10.15. How might the intensifying storm track activity potentially influence the latter's patterns? Can the current data from the two visualizations confirm a linkage between the two phenomena, and if so, how? Furthermore, given the SRES A1B emissions scenario, how might these patterns be expected to change over the course of the 21st century? If the data is insufficient to establish a direct relationship, advise on possible additional factors that need to be considered or additional data that would be beneficial to gather.
