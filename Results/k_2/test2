Question: 

How might the ECHAM4/OPYC greenhouse gas scenario run, over north-west Europe, indicated in Figure 9.30 impact the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC) at 30degN as depicted in Figure 10.15? As the MOC shows a reduction or slow down in various model simulations, what might be the implication or correlation between greenhouse gas scenarios and changes in MOC? Please explain your inference considering both the non-linear climate trend marked by the dashed line in Figure 9.30 and the lack of any projected abrupt state changes in MOC patterns within this century, indicated in Figure 10.15.
