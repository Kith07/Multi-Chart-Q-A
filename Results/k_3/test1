Question: 

Given the potential rise in global mean temperature change as presented in multiple future scenarios, which include even lower scenario (RCP2.6), lower scenario (RCP4.5), mid-high scenario (RCP6.0), and higher scenario (RCP8.5), and considering the mitigation potential in the electricity sector-based substitutions with nuclear and renewable energy, plus improvements in power generation plants and transmission efficiency, how could the projected increase in emissions from the uptake of unconventional oils by 2030 impact the overall carbon emissions trend? Specifically, what is the range of potential global mean temperature changes accounting for both the emissions reduction strategies and projected unconventional oil uptake?
