Question: Given the projected range in global mean temperature change illustrated in Figure ES.3 under different scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), how could these projections interact with the mitigation potential in the electricity sector as outlined in Figure 4.29? Specifically, what would be the estimated impact of switching from fossil-fuel thermal power stations to nuclear and renewable energy power generation and implementing energy-efficiency improvements on curbing the carbon emissions and hence the temperature rise under the higher scenario (RCP8.5)?
