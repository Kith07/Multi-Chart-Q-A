Question: Given the projected range in global mean temperature change under various emission scenarios, how might the mitigation strategies from Figure 4.29 contribute to limit future carbon emissions and prevent reaching the higher scenario (RCP8.5)? Specifically, will the offset of potential reductions from the greater uptake of unconventional oils by 2030 significantly hinder these mitigation efforts and result in a higher or lower temperature increase than predicted?
