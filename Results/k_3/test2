Question: Considering the different ranges of potential global temperature change presented in Figure ES.3 for the years 2081–2100, how would substituting existing fossil-fuel power stations with nuclear and renewable energy power generation and implementing energy-efficiency improvements in power-generation plants and transmission, as indicated in Figure 4.29, affect the carbon emissions and thus the future temperature change scenarios (1.1°–4.3°F under the even lower scenario (RCP2.6), 2.4°–5.9°F under the lower scenario (RCP4.5), 3.0°–6.8°F under the mid-high scenario (RCP6.0) and 5.0°–10.2°F under the higher scenario (RCP8.5))? Could such mitigation efforts potentially prevent us from reaching the higher temperature increase scenarios?
