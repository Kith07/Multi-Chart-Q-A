Question: Given the projected range in global mean temperature change in response to future carbon emissions scenarios, along with the indicated estimates for the mitigation potential in the electricity sector and the potential increased emissions from the greater uptake of unconventional oils by 2030, what would be the combined impact on global temperature rise by 2081-2100 if both substantial energy efficiency improvements in power-generation plants and transmission, and significant reductions in emissions from biofuels and vehicle-efficiency improvements, were achieved? In this scenario, how might the temperature changes differ under the lower scenario (RCP4.5) and the higher scenario (RCP8.5) and what role could switching from coal to gas play in these outcomes?
