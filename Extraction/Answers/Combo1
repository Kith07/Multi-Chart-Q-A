Answer: The connections between changes in the strength and variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) and global atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations can be delineated using insights from the provided charts. The first chart depicts varied projections of the MOC from multiple climate models over time, showing increasing variability and changes in strength, particularly evident post-2000. The second chart exhibits fluctuations in parts per million (ppm) of a greenhouse gas (likely CO2), which shows an increasing trend towards the latter half of the 21st century.

The strength and variability of the MOC influence oceanic heat transport and nutrient cycles, which in turn affect the absorption and release rates of CO2 from the ocean. A stronger MOC generally enhances oceanic heat transport towards the north, leading to warmer ocean temperatures in these regions, which can reduce the ocean's ability to absorb CO2, potentially increasing atmospheric CO2 levels. Conversely, a weakening MOC could slow down this heat transport, causing regional cooling and potentially increasing CO2 absorption by cooler waters.

Considering the projections indicating increased variability and potential weakening of the MOC by several models in the first chart, and the rising atmospheric CO2 levels in the second chart, it is plausible that changes in the MOC could contribute significantly to shifts in atmospheric CO2 concentrations through altered heat and carbon cycles.

The joint implications of these observations for future climate scenarios are significant. Enhanced atmospheric CO2 concentrations due to a weakened MOC can lead to more pronounced global warming, influencing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and heavy precipitation events, especially in regions proximal to the Atlantic. Furthermore, the alterations in heat transport associated with changes in the MOC could contribute to regional changes in sea levels. Regions experiencing warmer ocean temperatures might see higher local sea levels due to thermal expansion of water, whereas areas with cooling could witness lower sea levels.

Thus, the interplay between MOC variability and greenhouse gas concentrations has profound implications for climate change scenarios, particularly impacting the patterns and severity of extreme weather events and regional sea level changes through the combined effects of heat and carbon cycle changes driven by the MOC.
