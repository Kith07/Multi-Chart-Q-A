Answer: The set of charts provided elucidates distinct aspects of climatic changes, ranging from historical temperature fluctuations to future projections and risk assessment associated with extreme weather events under specific warming scenarios. By synthesizing observations from these charts, it's possible to comprehend how increases in extreme weather events such as heavy precipitation may influence the Risk of Concern (RFC) categories in light of global warming.

The historical temperature chart indicates fluctuations such as the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age, followed by a sharp increase in temperatures primarily observed through thermometer-based records post the 19th century. This recent rapid warming is pertinent as it sets the backdrop against which current and future climatic extremes are evaluated.

Transitioning to future projections, the first chart illustrates the probability ratios (PR) of heavy precipitation events exceeding the 99th and 99.9th percentiles increase as a function of mean global warming. Particularly, even a 1°C increase in global warming leads to a notable increase in these extreme precipitation events, and this trend intensifies with warming up to 4°C.

The second chart further explores this aspect by displaying the probability ratio of extreme precipitation events (RX1day) under different warming levels up to 2°C. It highlights how even small increases in temperature significantly amplify the probability of these events, and this amplification becomes greater as the event rarity increases (e.g., from the 95th to the 99th percentile of precipitation events).

Finally, the chart depicting risks associated with RFC categories visually correlates levels of global temperature increase with confidence levels regarding impacts. RFC2, which evaluates risks associated with extreme weather events, shows a gradual transition toward very high confidence and risk levels correlating with increasing temperatures. Notably, under scenarios of 1°C to 2°C warming, widespread impacts and high confidence levels are evident, compatible with the earlier charts suggesting increased frequencies and intensities of extreme precipitation events.

To conclude, the increase in probabilities of extreme weather events like heavy precipitation as depicted in the provided charts aligns with escalated concerns and confidence levels in the RFC categories. As global temperatures continue to rise, the likelihood and severity of these extreme weather events are anticipated to increase, thereby elevating the related risks and concerns to very high levels, especially under high to very high global warming scenarios. Thus, the historical context of past temperature fluctuations combined with contemporary and futuristic data allows for a robust understanding of the heightened risks posed by global warming, underpinning the necessity for strategic climate adaptation and mitigation measures.
