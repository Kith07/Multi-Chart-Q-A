Answer: The analysis of geological data from File 1 and projections from File 2 allows for drawing informed conjectures regarding the potential impacts on global continental glaciation by 2100 under reduced fossil fuel consumption.

File 1 shows a historical correlation where lower atmospheric CO2 levels have been associated with periods of continental glaciation. The data also illustrate periods where significant drops in CO2 correspond with the buildup of ice sheets, particularly evident during the transition from the Eocene to the Oligocene. Here, the decline in CO2 facilitated the formation and expansion of ice sheets, namely in the Antarctic.

File 2 delineates a future scenario ('Scenario S') where there is a notable decrease in the consumption of all types of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas) by 2100. This scenario indicates a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions due to decreased reliance on fossil fuels, provided that these energy sources are substituted by lower-carbon alternatives such as nuclear and biomass, which are shown to have steady consumption levels in the scenario.

Connecting these observations, if the reduction in fossil fuel use under scenario 'S' continues to drive down CO2 emissions, historical precedents suggest that this could lead to colder global temperatures and potentially contribute to the onset or expansion of continental glaciation periods by 2100. The precedent in File 1 suggests a notable sensitivity of Earthâ€™s climate system to changes in atmospheric CO2 levels, linking these changes to significant climatic shifts such as glaciation.

Therefore, under the continued trajectory of scenario 'S', there is a potential that we might see a gradual increase in global continental glaciation. However, it remains critical to account for other factors such as deforestation, land use changes, and other greenhouse gases which also impact the climate system. Additionally, modern factors like solar radiation management and other forms of geoengineering might influence these outcomes.
