ANSWER: 0.3

EXPLANATION: 
To determine the semantic similarity score between the datasets provided in File 1 and File 2, I focused on a few key aspects: nature of independent and dependent variables, the scales (temporal resolution) of measurement, and the domain specificity of the datasets.

1. **Nature of the Independent Variables**:
   - **File 1**: Uses years to depict longitudinal data.
   - **File 2**: Uses months to depict longitudinal data.
   While both are time-based independent variables, their scales differ: years versus months.

2. **Nature of the Dependent Variables**:
   - **File 1**: Measures an environmental metric (sea level rise).
   - **File 2**: Measures health-related metrics (vaccine distribution ratios).
   These are distinctly different domains with no direct overlap in what is being measured.

3. **Domain Specificity and Context**:
   - **File 1** is rooted in climate science, analyzing environmental changes.
   - **File 2** is situated in healthcare, specifically public health and vaccine distribution.
   These represent different scientific contexts and would use largely non-overlapping methodologies and data interpretations.

4. **Data Presentation and Analysis Depth**:
   - Both files include multiple series data, implying a diversity of data sources or divisions within each plot:
      - **File 1**: Different lines likely represent different data sources or interpretations regarding sea level rise.
      - **File 2**: Each line represents a specific vaccine dose type and its distribution ratio.
   This suggests a similarity in the complexity of data presentation and relational analysis between two variables or datasets within each domain.

Considering these aspects, a score of 0.3 is designated. This score reflects that while both datasets utilize a time-based independent variable to track changes, and have complexity in their dependent variables through multiple data presentations, they represent very distinct scientific domains with differing types of dependent variables and differ significantly in their direct comparability and applicability in analyses. Hence, there is some base level similarity in methodology and data handling, but substantial differences in content, purpose, and context keep the semantic similarity relatively low.
