ANSWER: 0.35

EXPLANATION:
The semantic similarity score between the sets of attributes from File 1 and File 2 is determined by examining the nature of the variables and the contexts in which they are employed. This examination was conducted qualitatively based on the descriptions and types of variables involved:

**Overlap and Similarities:**
1. Both files share a common "Year" variable, although the specific years and their use in the datasets are different. In File 1, "Year" spans historical data from 1961 to 2008 and serves as a timeline for productivity data. In File 2, "Year" pertains to future projections for 2030 and 2050 and serves to delineate forecasts in emissions.
2. Both files utilize dependent variables that measure some outcome directly related to socio-economic or environmental impact (Productivity per Hectare in File 1 and CO2 Emissions in File 2).

**Differences:**
1. The subjects of the variables are quite distinct. File 1 focuses on agricultural productivity, categorizing data by crop type and measuring yield per hectare. File 2 is centered around projections of CO2 emissions under different future energy and policy scenarios, with additional reference lines to provide historical context and targets.
2. The set of independent variables in both files diverge significantly:
   - File 1 uses "Crop Type" as a categorical variable, which is specific to the type of crop being analyzed.
   - File 2 employs "Scenario" as a categorical variable outlining different energy policy projections, which fundamentally differs in implication and usage from the agricultural categorization in File 1.
3. The nature of "Year" as an independent variable serves a different purpose in both files, one being historical tracking and the other future forecasting.

Considering these observations, while there is a slight connection due to the shared use of temporal data (year) as an independent variable and a focus on a form of productivity or output measure as dependent variables, the overall themes, objectives, and contextual use of the remaining attributes vary substantially, leading to a moderate-low similarity score. Thus, a score of 0.35 reflects these points of both minor convergence and significant divergence in semantic context.
