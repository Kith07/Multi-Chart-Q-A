ANSWER: 0.25

EXPLANATION:
To determine the semantic similarity score between the set of attributes/variables in File 1 and File 2, a comparison on a scale from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (identical) is made, focusing on the function and significance of the variables in their respective scientific/contextual domains.

1. **Independent Variables:**
   - File 1: Year -> Time-related variable setting the stage for analysis over a period.
   - File 2: Time (Months) -> Also a time-related variable but with a finer granularity (monthly rather than annual).
   - Although both variables represent time, their context and granularity differ, offering a low to medium similarity. 

2. **Dependent Variables:**
   - File 1: Life Expectancy -> A demographic and health-related metric.
   - File 2: Precipitation Change, Temperature Change -> Climate-related metrics.
   - The nature and application of these dependent variables are quite different, focusing on vastly different aspects (human health versus environmental conditions). 

3. **Categorical/Additional Variables:**
   - File 1: Gender -> A demographic variable affecting life expectancy.
   - File 2: Confidence Intervals -> Statistical representation of uncertainty in climate data.
   - Gender and Confidence Intervals serve very different purposes and are related to different types of analyses (demographic category versus uncertainty in data projection).

Though there is a very basic similarity in the use of time-based independent variables, the overall contexts (human health versus climate science), purposes, and specific applications of the variables indicate a limited semantic similarity. The chosen score of 0.25 reflects recognition of this basic category overlap in time-based analysis but acknowledges significant differences in the other dimensions.
