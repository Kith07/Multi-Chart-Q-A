ANSWER: 0.75

EXPLANATION:
The semantic similarity score of 0.75 can be rationalized through analyzing how closely related the attributes from both files are, with respect to themes and concrete scientific measures, albeit with differing specifics.

1. **Central Theme**: Both files focus on greenhouse gases and their effects, management, or alteration in different contexts - atmospheric measurements in File 1, and forest management for carbon sequestration in File 2. This thematic overlap is significant as they both address aspects of environmental management related to CO2.

2. **Focused Elements**:
   - In File 1, CO2 and O2 concentrations directly measure atmospheric conditions, with annotations related to effects and results of varying processes (like fossil fuel burning). 
   - File 2 deals with forest management strategies aimed at storing carbon, mitigating its release (e.g., via afforestation, slowing deforestation), and the economic aspects (investment costs) associated with these strategies.

3. **Variables**: 
   - Both files use dependent and independent variables; however, the metrics differ.
   - File 1 uses parts per million for concentrations, a direct chemical measure.
   - File 2 employs tons of carbon per hectare for mitigation potential and dollar amounts for economic evaluation, integrating environmental science with resource management and economic evaluation.

4. **Specificity and Applications**:
   - File 1 is specific in its scientific description and quantification of atmospheric change over time, using timelines and process annotations.
   - File 2 broadens the scope to global strategies and economic factors, with a geo-economic aspect added through the inclusion of countries and regions.

Given these points, while there is not a direct one-to-one match between attributes in each file, their strong thematic continuity on managing and analyzing CO2, plus the overarching environmental management focus, justifies a high semantic similarity score. The score isn't perfect due to differences in the scope of application, units of measurement, and scientific specifics.
