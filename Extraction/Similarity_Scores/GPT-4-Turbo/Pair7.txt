ANSWER: 0.25

EXPLANATION: To determine the semantic similarity score between the attributes of File 1 and File 2, we need to consider both the types of attributes (independent or dependent) and their contextual relevance within their respective domains (Healthcare for File 1 and Climate Science for File 2).

1. **Type and Role of Attributes**: 
   - **File 1** features variables about staffing and settings in healthcare facilities, with a specific focus on the categorization by location and the depiction of target goals.
   - **File 2** notably dives into geospatial data, climate phenomena (NAO Index), and ecological impacts (like bird migration and plant phenology) across timelines.

2. **Semantic Relationship**:
   - There's a minimal thematic overlap. While both datasets include dependent variables that relate to outcomes (staffing numbers versus ecological changes/phenological data), the actual subjects and contexts are vastly different – human resource management in healthcare versus ecological and climatic observations in Climate Science.
   - The primary similarity is in the fundamental nature of plotting data against independent variables (like "Location Type" and "Year/Longitude/Latitude"), which serves to categorize or structure the observation framework.

3. **Depth of Interdisciplinary Connection**:
   - None of the variables in File 1 directly relate to or influence any variables in File 2. The attributes serve very distinct purposes specific to their fields without crossover implications, such as healthcare facility management versus environmental and climatic studies.
   - Subtly, both files do concern themselves with real-world monitoring and performance/condition assessments, but this high-level similarity doesn’t translate into deeper semantic similarity in terms of the specific attributes.

Considering these analysis points, a similarity score of 0.25 reflects a low but not nonexistent level of similarity, acknowledging primarily their shared use of data structuring through independent variables while recognizing the lack of thematic and practical overlap in the attributes.
