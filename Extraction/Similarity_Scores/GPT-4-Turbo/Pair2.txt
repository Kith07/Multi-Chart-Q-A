ANSWER: 0.75

EXPLANATION:
To determine the semantic similarity between the given sets of attributes/variables from the two files related to Climate Science and Energy, the semantic relationship between each category and its broader domain was considered:

1. **Independent and Dependent Variables**:
   - Both sets contain independent variables that drive changes observed in dependent variables. This structural similarity in data presentation contributes to semantic closeness.

2. **Nature of Variables**:
   - **File 1** deals with predictive modelling of future scenarios affecting global temperatures, implicating human socio-economic pathways and climate physics.
   - **File 2** focuses on emissions contributions from various sources and their future radiative forcing implications, which also underpin the climate change domain.
   - Both sets are centered on understanding and projecting impacts related to climate change, albeit through slightly different lenses (temperature projections vs. emission contributions).

3. **Specificity and Technicity**:
   - Variables in both files are technical and specific to their respective fields, contributing to a higher semantic similarity as they are underpinned by scientific methodologies, aiming at quantifying environmental impacts.
  
4. **Domain Overlap and Relatedness**:
   - Both files operate within the domain of environmental science and share a common goal of quantifying and modeling aspects related to climate change forecasting. The use of modeling scenarios and dependency on historical and projection data are conceptually related.

By measuring these factors, a score of 0.75 was assigned, indicating a substantial but not complete semantic similarity. This reflects an overlap in purpose (climate forecasting and environmental impact studies) and methodology (model-based predictions) but differs in the specific focus areas and variable types used (temperature increase versus greenhouse gas emissions and radiative forcing).
