ANSWER: 0.35

EXPLANATION:
To compute the semantic similarity between the set of attributes/variables from File 1 and File 2, we analyze the content and context of each variable:

1. **Contextual Domain**: Both files are rooted in the domain of renewable energy, specifically focusing on investments in energy technologies and their environmental impacts. This common domain suggests a moderate level of semantic similarity.

2. **Nature of Variables**:
   - In File 1, the variables are **Year** and **Global Investment in Hydropower**. These suggest a temporal trend analysis centered around financial data in renewable energy investments.
   - In File 2, the variables include **Type of Geothermal Power Generation Technology**, **Lifecycle GHG Emissions**, along with ancillary information variables such as **Number of Estimates** and **Number of References**. These variables are more technical and existential, focusing on technological categorizations and environmental impacts rather than financial metrics.

3. **Independence vs. Dependence**:
   - Both files feature independent and dependent variables. File 1 has **Year** as an independent variable and **Global Investment in Hydropower** as dependent, indicating a direct, time-based analysis.
   - File 2’s **Type of Geothermal Power Generation Technology** is independent, affecting **Lifecycle GHG Emissions** as the dependent variable, similarly linking the technology type to a measurable impact.

4. **Specificity and Technicality**:
   - File 1’s variables are broader and more financially oriented.
   - File 2’s variables are detailed, with technical specificities regarding technology types and environmental impact measurements.

Given these observations:
- **Commonalities**: Both deal with renewable energy and use an independent variable to explore impacts (financial or environmental).
- **Differences**: The specifics of the variables (financial vs. environmental and technical details), the complexity of technology considerations in File 2, and the additional layers of data context in File 2 (estimates and references), which indicate a more detailed scientific approach.

The score of **0.35** reflects these aspects, combining a moderate overlap in domain and analytical approach with significant differences in specific content, focus, and detail level. Hence, while there is some connection, substantial distinctions in their approaches and details underscore the chosen semantic similarity score.
