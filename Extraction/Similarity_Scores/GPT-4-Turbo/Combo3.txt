ANSWER: 0.65

EXPLANATION:
The scoring of semantic similarity between the attributes/variables from the charts or plots presented in the three files is estimated to be moderately high, at 0.65 out of 1. This analysis considers the overlap and connectivity between the descriptions, the thematic focus on climate-related metrics and changes, and the presence of independent and dependent variables linked to environmental phenomena.

1. **Common Themes**: All files focus on climate science metrics such as temperature changes, precipitation events, and historical climate phenomena. File 1 concentrates on precipitation, File 2 on historical temperature records, and File 3 on overall climate risk based on temperature changes and severity indices. Although each dataset emphasizes a different aspect of climate change, they share a unifying goal of elucidating climate-related trends and consequences.

2. **Variable Types and Relationships**: The files share an approach of utilizing independent and dependent variables to analyze climate impacts, which suggests a thematic and methodological coherence. This includes variables such as global mean temperature changes (File 1 and File 3), as well as historical temperature changes and variances (File 2). Though the exact metrics and variables differ (precipitation events in File 1, temperature records in File 2, and risk assessments in File 3), each aims to quantify and illustrate the impacts of climate phenomena using scientifically gathered data.

3. **Analytical and Descriptive Overlap**: There's a methodological overlap in how data is modeled and presented (e.g., using independent variables to study impacts on dependent variables), and the semantic themes of climate change and environmental impact assessment are visible across all datasets.

Thus, a score of 0.65 reflects a substantial but not complete semantic similarity, recognizing both the common scientific discipline and the diverse focuses and variables presented within each file. This interpretation addresses the degree to which these datasets would be considered relevant to someone studying the overarching themes of climate change impacts, despite their differences in detail and specific focus.
