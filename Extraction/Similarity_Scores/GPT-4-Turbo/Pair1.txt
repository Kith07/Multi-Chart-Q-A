ANSWER: 0.1

EXPLANATION:
To determine the semantic similarity score between the attributes of File 1 and File 2, I followed these steps:

1. **Categorization and Contextual Analysis**: Each attribute in both files was analyzed based on its domain (Healthcare and Energy) and the role it plays (independent vs. dependent variable, type of data presented). This helps in understanding the functional and thematic relevance of each attribute.

2. **Cross-Domain Relevance Analysis**: I evaluated if any of the attributes could be related or mapped across files, considering their usage in different scenarios:
   
   - **File 1** (Healthcare):
       - "Age Categories" (demographic data segmentation)
       - "Percentage of All Deaths Due to Disease Category" (healthcare outcome measure)
       - "Disease Categories" (type of healthcare issue)
   
   - **File 2** (Energy):
       - "Year" (temporal data segmentation)
       - "Capacity Factor (%)" (performance measure in energy production)
       - "Number of Projects" and "Megawatts (MW)" (infrastructure and scale of energy projects)

3. **Similarity Criteria**:
   - **Data Segmentation by Demographics/Time**: "Age Categories" and "Year" function as classifications for data segmentation, but one is demographic, and the other is temporal.
   - **Dependent Variables in Different Contexts**: "Percentage of All Deaths Due to Disease Category" as a healthcare outcome measure versus "Capacity Factor (%)" as a performance metric, both gauge performance/effectiveness but in vastly different sectoral contexts.
   - **Project and Infrastructure Scale**: There are no direct semantic counterparts in File 1 for "Number of Projects" and "Megawatts (MW)", reflecting the specialized context of energy infrastructure.

4. **Scoring**: Given these analyses, while there are basic structural similarities in data categorization (independent and dependent variables), the contextual and domain-specific relevance is notably low. Hence, a very low score of 0.1 reflects minimal semantic similarity, driven mainly by the methodological overlap of employing independent and dependent variables, and not by any substantial thematic or domain-based alignment.
