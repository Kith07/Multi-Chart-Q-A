ANSWER: 0.65

EXPLANATION:
To determine the semantic similarity score between the attributes/variables from the two files, we would consider both the similarity in the nature of the data variables and the domains of study.

Analysis of variables:

1. Both files include "Year" as an independent variable, which provides a direct semantic match. It's used similarly as a temporal axis in both datasets to study changes over time.

2. The domains of File 1 and File 2 both fall under the broad category of environmental studies, specifically focusing on aspects that influence or describe the environment's status (climate science and energy emissions). There's a thematic alignment in the overarching concern with environmental impact and changes over time.

3. The dependent variables, although not directly comparable, share thematic connections:
   - File 1 focuses on "Global CO2 Emissions" and associated strategies/scenarios which are specifically tied to climate change impacts and mitigation.
   - File 2 focuses on direct climate-related occurrences such as "Cold Spells," "Warm Spells," and "Heat Wave Magnitude Index." These variables deal with the effects and changes in climate conditions, which are indirectly linked to larger topics like CO2 emissions and global warming.

4. Semantic connections can be drawn between the impacts of global emissions on weather patterns (an implicit relationship where increased emissions can lead to more extreme weather events, which are the subject of study in File 2).

Given these points, a similarity score of 0.65 is proposed, reflecting a moderate to high level of semantic similarity based on the shared temporal domain (Year), the environmental focus, and implicit connections between climate phenomena and emissions. However, the score is not closer to 1 because the specifics of the dependent variables deal with different aspects (emissions and direct temperature-related effects in File 2).
