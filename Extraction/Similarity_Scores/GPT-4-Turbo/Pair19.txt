ANSWER: 0.65

EXPLANATION: The score quantifying the semantic similarity between the two sets of attributes drawn from the domains of Climate Science has been determined based on the following considerations and using qualitative judgment:

1. **Domain Relevance:**
   Both files present data in the context of environmental and climate science impacts. This immediately suggests a moderate to high level of similarity as they deal with effects and causes related to climate change.

2. **Attribute Types:**
   - Both datasets include temporal or scenario-based independent variables: File 1 uses `Year` and `Scenarios` while File 2 uses `Equilibrium pCO2` which also models a variable changing over time or experimental conditions.
   - Dependent variables in both files measure environmental impact phenomena (`Sea Level Rise` in File 1 and `Cumulative emissions of CO2` in File 2), though they reflect different aspects of climate impact.
   - File 1 explicitly uses scenario categorizations, which is a qualitative similarity with File 2’s scenarios implied by different levels of pCO2.

3. **Functional Relationships:**
   - Both files operate on the principle that a key independent variable (whether time or CO2 pressure) affects an environmental dependent variable. They supplement these relationships with additional data (`Scenarios` and `ΔpH`), enhancing comprehensiveness and contextuality in environmental assessments.

4. **Potential Cross-Disciplinary Linking:**
   - CO2 levels potentially affect both sea levels and emissions in reality, suggesting an intrinsic link between the datasets in terms of broader climate modeling.

The assigned score reflects these similarities, acknowledging that while the specific variables differ, the overarching thematic connection around climate impact and modeling ties the datasets together. The difference in the specific environmental focus (oceanic chemical changes vs. sea level) and the directness of the variable relationships prevent a higher similarity score, indicating that these datasets could be complementary in a larger analytical context rather than redundant.
