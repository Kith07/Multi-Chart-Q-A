ANSWER: 0.6

EXPLANATION:
The semantic similarity score between the attributes from File 1 and File 2 has been determined as 0.6 on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no similarity and 1 indicates a perfect match. Here's the breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Shared Variable - Year:**
   Both sets include a 'Year' variable used similarly as an independent temporal metric, suggesting a high degree of similarity in how time is treated in the analyses.

2. **Nature of Dependent Variable:**
   - File 1: *Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) at 30°N in Sverdrups (Sv)* - This measures a specific oceanographic parameter reflecting major climate-influencing ocean currents in terms of volume flow rate.
   - File 2: *Activity in ppm* - This likely refers to environmental measurements which could be gaseous concentrations. Compared to File 1’s ocean circulation metrics, this seems more general but still relevant to environmental and climate sciences.

3. **Use of Different Models and Historical Data:**
   - File 1 specifically discusses using various climate models to estimate the behavior of MOC, incorporating a robust approach to understand variability in climate predictions.
   - File 2’s explanation lacks explicit mention of using different models or historical data references; however, the implication of modeling or historical comparison could be subtly inferred from the mention of time-lapse representation (1860-2100) and variability shading.

Given the contextual alignment in domain (both sets tackle climate-related parameters) and overlapping use of time as a metric, the overall semantic similarity is substantial but not maximal due to differences in specific dependent variables and detailed data modeling approaches. Hence, a score of 0.6 appropriately reflects these shared and differing semantic dimensions.
