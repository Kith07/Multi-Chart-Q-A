ANSWER: 0.2

EXPLANATION:
The score denoting the semantic similarity between the set of attributes/variables from File 1 and File 2 is calculated based on an analysis of the nature of the datasets, the type of variables, and thematic content. 

1. **Nature of Data**: Both files represent statistical data, but their contents diverge significantly in scope and domain. 
   - File 1 discusses ecological and environmental metrics (e.g., surface area, carbon stocks) categorized by biome types.
   - File 2 focuses on financial metrics (e.g., funding amount, funding source) categorized by institutions.

2. **Type of Variables**:
   - Both files include dependent and independent variables, but the kinds of dependent and independent variables differ vastly. File 1 uses predominantly ecologically oriented variables, while File 2's variables are financially oriented.
   
3. **Thematic Content**:
   - File 1 covers biogeographical and carbon-sequestration metrics, which are specific to climate science and environmental studies.
   - File 2 addresses financial contributions and sources in the context of funding for potentially varying causes.

4. **Linguistic/Semantic Overlap**:
   - There is minimal direct semantic overlap in the attributes. The themes address entirely different aspectsâ€”one from a natural science perspective and the other from an economic or financial perspective.

Given these observations, the semantic similarity score is low, reflecting the significant thematic divergence between the datasets from entirely different domains (Biogeography/Climate Science vs. Financial/Economic). A score around 0.2 reflects this limited similarity, primarily based on the shared structural format of data presentation (both using categories and measurements), but divergent in all other analyzed aspects.
