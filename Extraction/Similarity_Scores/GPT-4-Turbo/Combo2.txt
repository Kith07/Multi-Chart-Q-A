ANSWER: 0.2

**EXPLANATION:**
To determine the semantic similarity score between the attributes/variables from File 1 and File 2, we first analyze the context and the subject matter of each file. 

- **File 1 (Climate Science Domain):** The variables largely focus on paleoclimate data such as atmospheric CO2, ocean temperatures, glaciation, and geochronological data of ice sheets. These are historical, geo-scientific data points that are analyzed over geological periods (millions of years).

- **File 2 (Energy Domain):** The attributes revolve around modern energy sources, consumption measured over much shorter timeframes (years 2030 and 2100), and the impact of different scenarios on future energy use. These are contemporary data points specifically related to energy production and consumption projections.

Given that File 1's domain deals with historical climatic and environmental changes through geological periods while File 2 focuses on predictive modeling of energy consumption in the near future under various scenarios, the relevance and connection between the sets of attributes in terms of subject matter and temporal dimensions are minimal. Therefore, the semantic similarity can be considered quite low.

However, there is a minor connection in the broader context of environmental and climatic influences where the emission (e.g., from burning fossil fuels considered in File 2's energy sources like coal, gas, and oil) may contribute to atmospheric conditions (like CO2 levels discussed in File 1). This indirect relationship provides a minimal but non-negligible baseline of similarity, hence the score reflects a low (but greater than zero) value of semantic similarity, quantified here at 0.2.
