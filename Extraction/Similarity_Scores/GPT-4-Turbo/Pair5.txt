ANSWER: 0.75

EXPLANATION:
To determine the semantic similarity between the set of attributes/variables from File 1 and File 2, I followed these steps:

1. **Common Ground**: Both files share a focus on environmental/climate-related data, with variable types covering both dependent and independent variables, alongside categorical attributes that help segment the data for deeper analysis. They both deal with the measurement of cumulative changes over time, emphasizing environmental impacts. There is a connection in the dependence on time as a key factor (years versus specific years of 2030 and 2100), both dealing with large-scale environmental measurements (Gt CO2, kg/m², Gt).

2. **Differences**: The specific subject matter differs significantly. File 1 focuses on CO2 emissions and reduction scenarios based on policy or technological changes, primarily based around human interventions into environmental issues. It uses cumulative emissions and reductions in scenarios tied explicitly to human activities affecting CO2 levels. Conversely, File 2 deals with the physical natural changes in ice mass balance due to climatic conditions over various Arctic regions, documenting impacts without direct human intervention focus.

3. **Variable Type Matching**: Both files use cumulative measurements of physical quantities (masses and balances), time as either an independent or contextual attribute, and categorical differentiation (geographical or scenario-based). However, their direct variables assigned as dependent/independent do not fully overlap, and the nature of categories is different (scenarios versus geographic locations).

4. **Semantic Overlap**: The files have significant overlap in discussing environmental impacts over time with numerical quantification and segmentation for analysis. Both data presentations would appeal to specialists in climate and environmental studies, although from slightly different angles—File 1 from intervention outcomes, and File 2 from natural processes study.

Based on this evaluation, the files have substantial commonality in the type of data and how it's handled but differ in core subject specifics. This leads to a high semantic similarity score, reflected as 0.75, to indicate strong relatedness but notable subject-matter divergence.
