ATTRIBUTES:
1. Year (Independent Variable)
2. Production Capacity (Dependent Variable)
3. Technology Type (Categorical Independent Variable)

EXPLANATION:
- **Year**: The year on the x-axis represents specific time points (2006, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2015) indicating when the data was recorded or calculated. This is the primary independent variable that helps in observing changes over time in the production capacity.
  
- **Production Capacity**: Measured in Megawatt-hours (MWh/year) and represented on the y-axis, this attribute denotes the amount of solar energy production capacity generated by different types of solar panel technologies. It is the key dependent variable that varies with technology type and time.

- **Technology Type**: This is a categorical independent variable indicated by the color coding in the chart: blue for "Crystalline Wafer Silicon" and yellow for "Thin Films". Each color represents a different type of technology used in solar panels, affecting the total production capacity.
