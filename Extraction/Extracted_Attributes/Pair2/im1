ATTRIBUTES:
1. Scenario Categories (Independent Variable)
2. Global temperature increase (°C) (Dependent Variable)
3. Climate Models and Studies (Independent Variable)

EXPLANATION:
1. **Scenario Categories** - These are various scenarios under which the global temperature increase is projected. They include B1, B2, A1B, A1T, A2, A1FI, representing different socio-economic and environmental development pathways which affect CO2 emissions and other factors impacting climate change.

2. **Global temperature increase (°C)** - This attribute represents the increase in global temperature in degrees Celsius under each scenario. It varies depending on the scenario and the inputs from different climate models or studies.

3. **Climate Models and Studies** - Represented by various symbols and colors on the chart, these include a range of climate models and research outputs that have been used to predict the temperature increase. Each model or study, such as AOGCMs, MAGICC, BERN, Wigley, and others, provides a range of outcomes based on different assumptions, which are plotted on the graph. Different symbols and colors denote specific models or studies:
   - For example:
     - **AOGCMs 5-95%** (normal fit) shows the range of outcomes predicted by Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models in the 5th to 95th percentile.
     - **MAGICC mean** indicates the average output from the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change, considering standard carbon cycles.
     - **BERN2.5CC standard version** represents results from the Bern2.5 Climate Change model standard calculations.
     - **Harris 2006**, **Stott 2002/2006**, and others refer to specific studies conducted in those years that presented their predictions based on their unique methods and assumptions.

The graphical representation with varied symbols and colors for different models or studies provides a comparative visualization of how each predicts the temperature changes across different future scenarios, highlighting the physics uncertainty, and differing carbon cycle impacts as modeled by the various researchers and simulations.
