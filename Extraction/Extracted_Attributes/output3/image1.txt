ATTRIBUTES:
1. Global mean warming (°C) - Independent Variable
2. Probability Ratio (PR) of heavy precipitation events - Dependent Variable
3. Exceedance percentile (99th and 99.9th percentile) - Attributes of Dependent Variable
4. Event Probability (percentage) - Independent Variable
5. RX1day - Specification of Event Analysis

EXPLANATION:
1. **Global mean warming (°C)**: This represents the increase in global mean temperature compared to a baseline (usually pre-industrial levels). This is the independent variable in panel a, and is used to show how changes in global temperatures can impact heavy precipitation events.

2. **Probability Ratio (PR) of heavy precipitation events**: This ratio indicates how much more likely heavy precipitation events become with increased global warming. It serves as the dependent variable in both panels a and b of the chart. The PR values greater than 1 indicate an increase in the likelihood of heavy precipitation events relative to a baseline climate condition.

3. **Exceedance percentile (99th and 99.9th percentile)**: These lines in panel a categorize heavy precipitation events by intensity thresholds. The 99th percentile includes very extreme precipitation events, while the 99.9th percentile includes the most extreme events, representing a higher threshold.

4. **Event Probability (percentage)**: In panel b, the x-axis shows the probability of heavy precipitation events occurring, which is expressed as a percentage. Lower percentages indicate rarer events. This variable is independent and is used to analyze how the intensity of extreme precipitation events varies with different frequencies of occurrence.

5. **RX1day**: This term typically refers to the maximum amount of precipitation received in a single day, analyzed over a specified period. It is used as a metric for assessing heavy precipitation in studies related to climate and hydrology. In this chart, it seems to provide a context or focus for the types of events being analyzed particularly in relation to different global warming thresholds indicated in panel b.

This visualization collectively helps to understand the relationship between global warming and the probability/intensity of extreme precipitation events, vital for climate impact assessment and adaptation planning.
