ATTRIBUTES:
1. Year (Independent Variable)
2. Decadal Rate of Sea Level Rise (mm/yr) (Dependent Variable)
3. Different Data Series (Dependent Variable)
   - Solid Black Line
   - Dashed Black Line
   - Solid Blue Line
   - Dashed Red Line
   - Solid Green Line (very short segment)

EXPLANATION:
1. **Year**: This attribute represents the time from 1950 to shortly after 2000. It is plotted on the x-axis and serves as the independent variable, indicating the temporal dimension across which the other data is measured and compared.

2. **Decadal Rate of Sea Level Rise (mm/yr)**: Represented on the y-axis, this is the dependent variable showing the change in sea level rise rate per decade in millimeters per year. It measures the rate at which the sea levels are either increasing or decreasing every ten years.

3. **Different Data Series**:
   - **Solid Black Line**: This could represent a specific data set or observational study data regarding the decadal rate of sea level rise.
   - **Dashed Black Line**: This might represent another data set or a modeled estimate of the rate of sea level rise, perhaps calculated using different parameters or assumptions than the solid black line.
   - **Solid Blue Line**: Analogous to the black lines, this represents a separate dataset or model output, potentially from a different source or calculated with different climatic variables.
   - **Dashed Red Line**: This line might indicate an alternative projection or historical analysis, potentially showing different aspects or considerations in sea level studies.
   - **Solid Green Line**: Although only a short segment is visible, this could be either a projection or analysis starting or ending at the visible segment, likely representing a new or partial dataset.

The relationships among these lines can provide insights into variations in models, data collection methods, or interpretations in the climate science community concerned with sea level rise. This graph helps analyze trends, anomalies, and consistencies across different studies and models.
