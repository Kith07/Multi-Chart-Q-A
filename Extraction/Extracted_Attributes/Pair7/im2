### EXPLANATION:

**For panel (a):**
- **Longitude and Latitude:** These attributes represent coordinate reference points on the map used to geographically locate the displayed data concerning the NAO index values.
- **NAO Index:** Represents the North Atlantic Oscillation index, indicating climatic fluctuations in the North Atlantic region of the map. This index is visualized through the colored gradient on the map.

**For panel (b):**
- **Year:** Marks a timeline from 1950 to 2010 to display all the other variables, making it the fundamental temporal axis for the data shown.
- **NAO Index (FebMar):** Measures the North Atlantic Oscillation values specifically for the months of February and March across the years displayed. This index can influence climate patterns and is shown as a blue line.
- **Mean spring passage Helgoland:** Represents the average date or metrics related to the migration of birds through Helgoland in spring as a function of the year. This variable helps in studying the influence of climate changes on bird migration patterns and is depicted as the red line.
- **Mean laying Pied Flycatcher:** Indicates the average laying time or occurrence for the Pied Flycatcher birds, which can be used as a biological indicator of climate change impacts, shown as the green line.
- **Leaf unfolding Horse Chestnut:** Displays the timing of leaf unfolding in Horse Chestnut trees each year (light blue line), which can be another indicator of climatic variations.
- **Leaf unfolding Birch:** Shows similar data as the previous, but for Birch trees, depicted in the yellow line.
- **Temperature (FebMar, MarApr, MarAprMay):** These lines show average temperature recordings for specific springtime periods, which are key to understanding transitions in climatic conditions and their broader ecological impacts across years.

These temporal and ecological variables together help in understanding the interdependence of climatic variations, ecosystem responses, and phenological changes over decades.
