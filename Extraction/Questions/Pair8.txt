QUESTION 1: How does the proportional contribution of funding from governments, when compared to private financial institutions, align with the carbon stocks maintained in biomes primarily managed or protected by governmental policies (like national parks in Forest [Temperate] Fth and Tundra T biomes)?

QUESTION 2: Considering the estimated increase in carbon stocks from the Last Glacial Maximum to pre-industrial times across different biomes, such as Tundra (T) and Forest [Temperate] (Fth), what could be the role of strategic funding by development banks in supporting research or conservation projects aimed at further augmenting carbon sequestration in these specific biomes?

QUESTION 3: Given the significant surface areas covered by 'Grassland & Shrubland (G&S)' and 'Cropland (C)', and observing the historical decline in carbon stocks illustrated from pre-industrial to current times, what investment strategies should be prioritized by private financial institutions to simultaneously support sustainable agricultural practices and enhance carbon storage in these extensive biomes?

QUESTION 4: Based on the distribution of carbon stocks in freshwater biomes (FW) during the Last Glacial Maximum versus current estimates, how should funding from various sources be allocated to address the impacts of climate change on these biomes, particularly considering the vulnerability of freshwater resources?

QUESTION 5: Reflecting on the variation in carbon stocks from pre-industrial times to the present across various biomes, and recognizing the percentage of funding dedicated by development banks toward environmental issues, what areas of research or conservation should be prioritized to maximize the retention of carbon in biomes like Montane (ME) and Desert (D) which show drastic changes in carbon storage capacity?
