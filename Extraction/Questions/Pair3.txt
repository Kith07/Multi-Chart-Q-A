QUESTION 1: How can trends in Ice Volume Anomaly and Ice Thickness Anomaly over the period 1950-2000 be associated with variations in GDP, particularly in countries that have established significant GHG Emissions Reductions policies? 

QUESTION 2: Analyzing the relationship between Ice Volume Anomaly and Welfare Variation across various regions, can we infer how changes in polar ice conditions might have impacted living conditions and economic stability in those regions over time?

QUESTION 3: Given the correlation between GHG Emissions Reductions and Private Households' Consumption, how might changes in ice thickness and volume have potentially influenced consumption patterns in energy-intensive households between 1950 and 2000?

QUESTION 4: Can a predictive model be developed to forecast possible changes in GDP Variation and Welfare Variation based on the historical data of Ice Thickness Anomalies and Volume Anomalies, possibly integrated with GHG Emissions Reductions data?

QUESTION 5: How have different regional policies around GHG Emissions Reductions (as indicated by the Country/Region Indicator) potentially influenced the magnitude of the Ice Volume Anomaly and Ice Thickness Anomaly over the historical period, accounting for variables like GDP and Welfare Variation?
