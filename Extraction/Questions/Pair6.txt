QUESTION 1: How might the annual increase in carbon dioxide concentrations from 1960 to 2000 (Carbon Dioxide Annual Change in ppm) affect public health and potentially correlate with shifts in healthcare expenses categorized by "20,000 Ushs or more" in different types of healthcare facilities? Consider both direct and indirect impacts of environmental changes on public health economics.

QUESTION 2: Analyzing the trends in the Carbon Dioxide Airborne Fraction from 1960 to 2000, how could these environmental trends relate to the changes in the proportion of patients with no medical expenses in public versus private healthcare facilities? Can a relationship be established between deteriorating environmental conditions and increased healthcare accessibility or dependency?

QUESTION 3: Given the fluctuations in the Carbon Dioxide Airborne Fraction and annual CO2 increase, can we infer any potential impacts on public health that might explain the variations in patient payments at health centers (both public and private) from less than 10,000 Ushs to 19,999 Ushs? What preventive health strategies could be deduced for environmental health hazards?

QUESTION 4: Considering the cross-relation between increasing carbon dioxide levels (Described both by Annual Changes and Airborne Fraction) and the healthcare service utilization (indicated by payment categories), would areas with higher reported increases in CO2 levels see a different distribution in healthcare payment categories, particularly in “20,000 Ushs or more,” across different facility types?

QUESTION 5: How does the information on both the increasing levels of CO2 (either as annual addition or as a fraction remaining airborne) align with shifts in economic health patterns seen at healthcare facilities regarding the proportion of patients categorized under ‘10,000 to 19,999 Ushs’? Do these environmental factors impact preventive healthcare programs, potentially leading to higher healthcare costs reflected in this payment category?
