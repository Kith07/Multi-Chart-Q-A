QUESTION 1: How can multiple scenarios from the first file, which depict different economic and technological paths (Scenarios A1B, A1FI, A1T, A2, B1, B2), influence cumulative CO2 emissions from the second file, considering both sets of data project up to the year 2100? Can these projections help us derive specific policy interventions tailored to mitigate the adverse effects identified, such as rising sea levels?

QUESTION 2: Given the relationship between equilibrium pCO2 and Î”pH in the second file, what might be the implications of rising sea levels under Scenario B2 as projected in the first file on ocean acidity by the year 2100? How might these changing conditions affect marine life and coastal ecosystems if current trends continue unchecked?

QUESTION 3: How could escalating sea levels under high emission scenarios such as A1FI and A1B relate to the trends seen in cumulative CO2 emissions under high pCO2 conditions illustrated in the second file? Are there collaborative global strategy initiatives that can be inferred from the data to optimize outcomes under these high-risk scenarios?

QUESTION 4: Analyze the relationship between the lowest projection of sea level rise under Scenario B1 and changes in pH levels under equivalent low equilibrium pCO2 conditions from the second file. What strategies can nations adopt to achieve such low emission and pH change scenarios based on this analysis, and what are the potential benefits of maintaining such levels in terms of global coastal management?

QUESTION 5: Considering the data from both files, how might the variability bands in sea level projections relate to the uncertainty demonstrated in cumulative CO2 emissions as pCO2 increases? What kind of predictive modeling enhancements are necessary to better refine these variability ranges and improve confidence in future planning for coastal and environmental policies?
