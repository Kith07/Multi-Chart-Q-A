QUESTION 1: How has the trend in global investments in hydropower between 2004 and 2009 potentially influenced the technological advancements and the subsequent lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions in geothermal power generation technologies?

QUESTION 2: Considering the varying lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of different geothermal power generation technologies (Flashed Steam vs. Enhanced Geothermal Systems), how might these emissions compare with the global hydropower investments in correlating years (2004 to 2009) regarding their environmental impact and investment attraction?

QUESTION 3: Given the data covering global investments in hydropower from 2004 to 2009, which geothermal power generation technology (Flashed Steam or Enhanced Geothermal Systems) appeared to be more sustainable in terms of GHG emissions and potentially more compatible with the changing scales of investments in renewable resources?

QUESTION 4: Can the increased number of references and estimates related to GHG emissions for each geothermal power technology provide a reliable trajectory of the global investment shifts in hydropower over the years 2004 to 2009, suggesting a correlation between economic and technological research focus in renewable energy?

QUESTION 5: How could the pattern of GHG emissions from different geothermal power generation methods (particularly between Flashed Steam and EGS) influence future global investment strategies in renewable energy, taking into account the historical investment data in hydropower from 2004 to 2009?
