QUESTION 1: How does the expected increase in GtC/yr emissions projected by the various climate models (e.g., AIM, MERGE, PEF) from the year 2020 to 2050 correlate with the observed fatality rates associated with fossil fuel energy sources (coal, oil, gas) in non-OECD countries? This question aims to analyze if the increase in carbon emissions from fossil fuels is translating to higher health risks in regions with less stringent environmental regulations.

QUESTION 2: Considering the range between 'Database Max' and 'Database Min' projections for GtC/yr in the year 2100, what could be the implications on fatality rates in OECD regions, specifically due to the continued use of coal and oil as primary energy sources? This question explores the potential increase in fatalities linked to air quality degradation caused by high carbon emissions scenarios in industrially advanced regions.

QUESTION 3: How might shifts in energy policies toward renewable sources, as suggested by the lower future GtC/yr emissions scenarios under certain climate models, impact fatality rates in regions like EU 27, known for stringent environmental and safety regulations? Here, the inquiry is directed at understanding if a lower carbon emissions future due to renewables adoption could significantly lower energy production-related fatalities.

QUESTION 4: What is the projected impact on global carbon emissions if every major region (OECD, non-OECD, EU 27, and China) were to reduce their reliance on the highest fatality rate energy sources (coal) and transition to lower emission technologies such as renewables? This question seeks to combine carbon emission reduction trajectories with changes in energy sourcing to assess potential global benefits in terms of both environmental impact and human safety.

QUESTION 5: Can the variability in carbon emissions projections among different climate models be linked to specific energy production choices in top emitting regions, such as China and non-OECD countries, especially focusing on the correlation between coal usage and GtC/yr outcomes in 2040? This question evaluates the indirect effects of certain energy policies on climate projections, particularly analyzing how the choice of energy source might be affecting regional and global carbon predictions.
