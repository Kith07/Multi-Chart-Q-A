QUESTION: Considering the observed historical trends of temperature changes from the year 300 to 2000, including variations attributable to the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age, how might the projected increases in event probabilities for extreme weather occurrences, such as heavy precipitation events at the 99th and 99.9th percentiles, align with the Reason for Concern (RFC) categories that evaluate risks like extreme weather events and large-scale singular events, particularly in scenarios of high to very high confidence levels of global warming impacts? This query integrates the recorded past fluctuations in global temperatures with the present understanding and future projections of weather extremities and their associated risks as depicted across the described charts.
