QUESTION 1: How might fluctuations in Global GHG Emissions under the A1T scenario from 2000 to 2100 potentially influence the incidence of respiratory illnesses in both males and females, considering trends in health data from 1990 to 2010?

QUESTION 2: Considering the variations in the post-SRES Range (80%) for GHG emissions and observed trends in new cases per 100,000 people differentiated by gender from 1990 to 2010, what might be the health impact projections for respiratory diseases in a high emission scenario like A1FI by the mid-21st century?

QUESTION 3: In the context of emission scenarios aimed at stabilization (such as B1 and B2), how can observed past healthcare trends from 1990 to 2010 assist in planning for gender-specific health interventions in areas most affected by climate change?

QUESTION 4: With the A2 scenario predicting a higher range of global GHG emissions, how could this influence future gender-specific health policies, especially considering the different rates of increase in new cases per 100,000 among males and females observed from 1990 to 2010?

QUESTION 5: Based on the interplay between GHG emissions under various scenarios such as B1, A1T, and A1B and the gender-differentiated health data between 1990 and 2010, what preventive health measures could be prioritized to mitigate the projected increase in diseases due to worsening air quality and global warming?
