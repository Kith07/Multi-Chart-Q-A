QUESTION 1: How does the cumulative CO2 emissions reduction by 2030 in Scenario III compare with the projected cumulative mass loss in gigatonnes (Gt) across Arctic Canada by the same year, and what implications might these trends have for understanding the climatic relationships between global CO2 management efforts and regional ice melt rates?

QUESTION 2: By evaluating cumulative CO2 emissions and the mass balance of glaciers in Northern Scandinavia up to the year 2100 under Scenario V, can we predict the potential environmental impact on this Arctic region considering advanced emissions reduction technologies and their effectiveness?

QUESTION 3: Given the cumulative climatic mass balance data from Svalbard and the cumulative emission reductions planned under Scenario IV by 2100, what correlations exist between extensive emissions control strategies globally and localized glacier volume changes in high Arctic zones?

QUESTION 4: What is the comparative effect of CO2 emissions scenarios (I and II) on the cumulative climatic mass balance in Iceland and Alaska by 2030, taking into account both their specific geography and the significantly different approaches to emissions reductions?

QUESTION 5: Considering the cumulative mass loss in gigatonnes from the Pan-Arctic and the individual scenarios (III, IV, and VI) aimed at reducing emissions by 2100, how can policy-makers leverage this data to formulate geographically tailored climate adaptation strategies for different Arctic regions?
