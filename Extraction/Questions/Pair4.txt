QUESTION 1: How does the projected CO2 emissions in 2050 under the IEA-WEO2009-Baseline scenario compare to the change in productivity per hectare of sugarcane from 1961 to 2008, and what implications might this have for sustainable agricultural practices in sugarcane farming?

QUESTION 2: Given the increase in productivity per hectare for maize from 1961 to 2008 and the CO2 emissions forecasts for 2030 under the ReMind-Recipe scenario, what steps can be taken to enhance maize yield sustainably without contributing disproportionately to the projected CO2 emission levels?

QUESTION 3: Analyzing the productivity trends of wheat between 1961 and 2008 alongside the CO2 emissions benchmark of 30% of 2008's emissions by 2050, how might advances in agricultural techniques need to evolve to ensure lower carbon footprints in wheat production?

QUESTION 4: Considering the productivity gains in paddy rice per hectare by 2008, compare these improvements with the emission scenarios set for 2030 by MiniCAM-EMF22. What strategies should rice growers adapt to align rice cultivation practices with the emerging stringent CO2 emissions standards?

QUESTION 5: Reflecting on the trends of rapeseed productivity from 1961 to 2008 and juxtaposed against the ER-2010 scenario emissions for 2050, can biofuel production from rapeseed be justified environmentally, or what innovations might be needed to make this crop a viable, low-emission biofuel source in the future?
