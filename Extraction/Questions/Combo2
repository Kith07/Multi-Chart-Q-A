QUESTION: Given the projected decline in fossil fuel energy consumption (coal, gas, oil) from 2020 to 2100 under scenario 'S' according to File 2, coupled with geological data showing historical correlations between reductions in atmospheric CO2 levels and the expansion of continental glaciation as depicted in File 1, what is the potential impact on global continental glaciation by 2100 if current trends towards reduced fossil fuel use under scenario 'S' continue, considering the historical evidence that links lower atmospheric CO2 levels with increased glaciation periods?
