QUESTION 1: How might the production capacity of Crystalline Wafer Silicon in 2015, as depicted in your first dataset, influence the predicted forced temperature trend for the time period 2010-2039 as shown in the second dataset? Consider how increased solar energy production could potentially mitigate temperature rises due to anthropogenic forcing.

QUESTION 2: Given the consistent fluctuations in production capacity for Thin Film technology from 2006 to 2015 and considering the unforced temperature trend remains relatively flat, can we infer a correlation between global temperature stabilization and the adoption of certain solar technologies? Analyze the potential impact of technology choice on natural temperature variability in relation to the presented data.

QUESTION 3: Can advancements in technology types, such as the shift from Crystalline Wafer Silicon to Thin Films (with their distinct production capacity trends), help explain or be explained by the progressive divergence between the forced and unforced temperature trends over the significant time periods (t1-t4) outlined in the second dataset?

QUESTION 4: Analyze the impact of changes in the annual solar energy production capacity of Crystalline Wafer Silicon and Thin Films between 2009 and 2012 on the forced temperature projections for the time period 2010-2039. How might differences in technology adoption and capacity increases connect to anticipated climate change scenarios driven by human activities?

QUESTION 5: How could the correlation between technology type-specific production capacities and the steep rise in forced temperature trends be used to guide future policy decisions on renewable energy technology deployment, particularly with respect to achieving temperature stabilization goals during the time periods t3 and t4 (2040-2099) described in the second dataset?
